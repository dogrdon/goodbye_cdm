            <pagetext>THE subject of this Narrative, J A B   E S WILSON,   as born on  the 27th of November 1809. His parents were in poor circumstances  : and when he was about the age of 11  elhvies father died.  Shortly afterwards, his mother, in order to obtain a livel hood,w ent  through the town and conntry hawking small wares and delf, and  as she was from home in general from morning lill late at night,  he sauntered about the streets, and, no doubt, poor fellow, he would  often have been destitute of food, had it not been for some humane  persons who had compassion on him, esteeming hiin at  object of  charity; some gave him victuals, others gave him a few pence,  which he carried home, till within a few years of his death, when  he spent the greater part of them on some useless trash or other,  and sometimes on a dram.  In the year 1820, one fine Summer's afternoon, he wandered  with some idle boys who went in search of birds'-nests, and having  stopped till it was getting rather late in the evening, his mother  became alarmed for his safety, and whilst she was out in search of  him, Jamie returned home. He had not patience to wait till she  should return, as he was very hungry; accordingly he broke open  the door. He no sooner got in, than he searched the whole hpuse  for something to eat, and at last spied a loaf on the top of the c u p  board ; he immediately laid seige to it, but he had no sooqer do*  so, than down he came, cupboatd and all it contained. When his  mother came home, and saw all her crockery lying in the floor  broken, it enraged her so much, that she got hold of a large strgp,  (probably kept for the purpose,) and gave Jamie a terrible drpbbing,  which so much displeased him, that he never would reside with her  after, but from that time sEept on stairs and other places, till some  humane individual took compassion on him, and afterwards gave  him shelter.  He was a quiet, harmless being, and gave no person the smallest  offence whatever; he was such a simpleton, that he would not  fight to defend himself, though he ,were ever so ill-used, even by  the smallest boy. Little boys, about the age of five and. six, have  frequently been observed by the Cits of Edina going before him  holding up their fists, squaring, and saying they would fight him ;  Jam ew oul-d have stood up l i e a knotless thread, and said, with

Then about a thousan' gets, hardiy out o' the eggshell,  wouldhave taken flight after him, bauling out, Jamie, Jamie,  Daft Jamie ; sometimes he would have stopped and turned round to  them, hanging his brow, squinting his eyes, shooting out his lips,  (which was the sign of his being angry) saying, What way de ye ca'  me daft? Ye ir, the little gets would have bauled out. I'm  no, though, (said Jamie) as sure's as death, devil take-me, I'm no,  daft, at a'. Ye ir, ye ir, the gets would have bauled out ; he then  would have held up his large fist, which was like a Dor6y's mell,  saying, if ye say I'm daft, I'll knock ye down; he would then  have whirled round on his heel and ran off again, acting the racehorse.  One day, in George's Street, Jamie was accosted by a respectable  gentleman, whu said to him, Come along with me, Jamie, and I  will give you an old coat. I thank ye, I thank ye, Sir, replied  Jamie, I've got plenty o' auld yens at hane. But the gentleman  had not proceeded many yards before Jamie ran after him, and asked  him if it was a guid ane ? 0 yes, said the geiltleman ; so Jamie  accompanied him to his house, when the gentleman not only gave  him the coat, but a hat and a pair of shoes ; and although it was a  very cold and slushy day, he could not persuade Jamie to put  on either the hat or shoes; and when he askcd Jamie why  he would not put them on ? The answer that Jamie gave him was,  that he did nae want to wear them in sick hard times as these.  Jamie was a great snuffer, and used a brass snuff-spoon when hc  took a pinch ; and to all those who made free with him, he give  his box, saying, '' tak' a sn7rf;  the pen or spoon, had seven holes,  which he said was a' the days o' the week, and the middle hole hc  named Sunday.  He had a rote of telling how many lamps there were in town,-  how many months, weeks, and days there were in a year ; also  how many days there were in each month and week; likewise, the  days of the week, and when Sunday came; this he knew from  different peop e putting him in mind of them.

            <pagetext>borv luany i,nr,l s there were in town ? IIe sometimes would have  said, there were five thousan', twinty, ten, a hunder.  Sometimes he was asked, What month in the year the ladies  talked least ? He would have said, the month o' February, becuz  there wiz least days in't.  Others aould have asked him, Why is a Jailor like a Musician  ? He answered, becuz he lraun tak' care o' his key.  Others again, would have asked him, What is the cleanest meat  that a dirty cook can make ready ? A hen's egg is the cleanest,  said Jamie, for she canna get her fingers in't. t' tak' a slake  o't.  Jamie was highly pleased when any person put these guesses to  him ; but if they put any to him that he did not know, he would  look sulkily at them, and say, be did nae ken that yen-it was nane  o' his guesses. Ah   nather  t is, Jamie, I forgot, it's no a guid  yen, (the bye-standers would have said), Jamie then would have  said, I can tell yc a' a guess, that nae body kens, nor nae body cun  guess't. What is't, Jamie? (some of them would have said.)  Then Jamie imrnedlately recited it, half laughing, which is as foltows  :-  Tho' I black an' dirty am,  An' black, as black can be ;  There's muny a Lady that will come,  An' by the haun' take me.  Sow ye'el no nane o' ye guess canna that. Ah no, Jamie, we  canna guess that fickly ane, wha learned ye a' thae fickly guesses ?  Jamie replied, It wiz my half step-mither, for she's a canty body,  for she's aye as canty as a kittlen urhen we're a' sittin' beside her  round the fire-side, she tells is heaps o' funny stories, but I dinna  mind them a*. Weel, but ye'll can tell us some o' them (says a  by-stander) I, says Jamie, she, she tells us about Cock Roben;  the King o' the Cobblers ; the House that Jack built ; an' heaps 0'  funny funny yens that I dinna mind.  Ah   I ken yaur guess Jamie (says rr. Ily-stander) it is a tea  kettle. Becuz ye ken, becuz somebody telt you ; and then Jamie  would have ran off.

            <pagetext>ti  Jamie was highly pleased when any person hail been givcn hiti2  praise fbr any thing he had done.  The porters of the Adam's Square stance were well up to humouring  Jamie, for many long and serious cracks they had with him,  and some of them wonld have taen, but he never urould leave  them without presenting his box to them to take a pinch  The porters would have asked him why he did not wear such a  piece of dress that such a person gave him ? Jamie u ould have said  I t wiz o'er guid for him to wear; for when he had guid claes on  the folk did nae gie him ony thing.  One night, when Jamie was rather late in going home to his  foster parents' house, all the rest of the children had taken them  seats round the fire, and some of them had hid his stool, and told  him it was lost, and he would have to sit on the bare floor ; Nae, said  Jantie, 1'11 tak' the kail pat for ae night, which he did ; but poor fellow,  he had no sooner sat down, than the lid and he fell into the  pat, atid it was upwatds Of twenty minutes before he could get out,  though several ahld wives assisted him.  Nothing offended Jamie more, than to put on his head a woman's  noutch; the origin of his aversion to a woman's cap was, that  at one time he had a fever ant  got his head shaved, and of course  he got on a cowl, or night-cap, and he blamed the cap for taking a'  his hair aura'.  Jamie was for many years (before he fell a victim,) never known  to be absent a day, forenoon, afternoon, nor evening, (or even a t  any other time, if he got nolice that there mere a sermon) from  Mr Aikman's Chapel ; it was astonishing how regularly he attended  that place of worship, without any person going with him;  he had n sweet voice, and sang when he heard the congregation   ging ; but he never uttered any words that a person could make  iny dense of; several attempted to entice him to go into the  Chdic Chapel, which is only next door to Mr A's, but f ainie said he  pattnae gang t' ony body's kirk but his ain ; Jamie said he ltked  Sunday aye best, for he gaed to I,ady - after the kirk cam out,  baith afternoon an' it night, and got meat and kail.  At one timk when Jamie was sauntering in Hunter's Square, a  coachmla Of that Stance got hold of him, and requested him to

Ah, says Boby, did ye get  a ride Jamie ? Ay, says Jamie, but no' far. The waggish coachman  then got Jamie and Boby to dance, which caused a great crowd  to gather; but a policeman came and dispersed the whole concern.  At one time, when Jamie was at a very respectable old maiden's  house in George's Street, which he often frequented, the flunky and  cook were very kind to him; the former of them shaved him : one  day when going to put the suds on him, he said he did nae think he  wad shave him ony mair, unless he gave Peggy a kiss ; Jamie replied,  but maybe Mem wad be angry. No, no, said the flunk:  she'll no' be angry, for who can she ken, she'll no' see ; Jamie then  turned round his head, half laughing at Peggy; but Peggy sdid, a  tweel a wat norJamie, ye'll no kiss me wi' that lang beard, it wad  jag a' my lip ; then the flunk' proceeded to shave him, when done,  Jamie peeped into a mirror to see how he looked, according to custom,  and when he had got his shirt-neck up like a dandy, Peggy  insisted on having a kiss ; but Jamie clapped his hands on his mouth  saying ye'r no bonny lass, ye'r no bonny for me, and since you was  proud, 1'11 be saucy, I'm a ddndy now. Wee1 then, said Peggy,  let me see how the dandies walk : so Jamie marchcd up and down  the kitchen, like a hen in a gutter, with his head up like a Peacock  or a BubLly-Sock.

            <pagetext>Ifany attempts were made by the vulgar to coax Jamie and Boby  to fight, but they could never get their wish accomplished; for  J a d e always saicl   he would not fight. for only bad boys  vould  fight.  The only quarrel they ever had was in the K lling Market.  A caddie, known by the name of Wag Fell, generally employed by  the clytery-wives, in procuring lamb's-blood t' mak' bloody yuddess,  the stratagem that this Wag fell on to sct these two idiots at loggerheads  was the follou ing:- he gave Boby a putrilied sheep's headc  saying,  it wad ma7c' a fine fry, Boby ;  and shortly after he had got  it in his possession, Wag desired him to lay down the head, and stir  the blood with a stick which stood in a pail ; and wh le Boby was  engaged in doing so, Wag took up the head, unperceived by Boby,  and gave it to Jamie, desiring him to   rin hume an' get it boilt ;   but Jamie had not ran many steps before Wag told Boby that  Jamie had steult his head, and ordered him to run after him and  take it frne him. Boby immediately set off, roaring, Daft Jamie  gies my head, and overtook him, and laid hold of the head, saying,  '2 my head ;  but Jamie held it fast and would not give it up, saying,    it was his head for he got it ;  they struggled for n considerable  time; when Boby saw he could not get it from Jamie,  he struck him so violently on the nose that it bled profusely;  Jamie would not strike again, but held the head firmly, kept it  in spite of Boby, and ran otT with it.?  At one time, when Jamie and his old companion Boby, met  in the Grassmarket, they clubbed to have a gill of whisky, and accordingly  went into a shop there to get a counter dab; at the  moment the gill stoup and glass were placed on the counter, Boby  asked Jamie to light his pipe and give him a smoke ; so Jamie  A great many butchers, caddies, and idle boys assembled round  Jamie and Boby ; some desiring Boby to take the head frae Jamie;  and others were bawling to Jamie to keep it, for it was his ain ;  others were roaring out a fight, a fight, strike him Boby ; others  exclaiming, thump him Jamie, thump him.  9 When these two idiots met, if either of them had any thing to  cat, the one alwasy gave the other the half of what hc had.

'L Ky, said Roby, because I was dry.   At one time, when Jamie was a little musky, he was accosted by  a woman who had got a black eye. Oh   fy, fy, Jamie, it is a  great shame to see you, or any such as you tak' drink. A weel,  says Jamie, what I ha'e in me, you, nor nane like ye, can tak' out;  an' what way hae you got that blue eye ? Hae ye faun on the tub  nae, when ye was washin' ? This abashed the woman a little, to  hear such a question come from him, and she muttered, that she  got it on the sncck o' the door last night. Ou I, said Jamie, ye  ken ye maun tell the best story ye can, but I ken ye 'hae been fom  when ye got it, an' by yer imprudent tongue t' yer gudeman, he  had taken ye through the heckle pins ; I saw ye yesterday whar ye  sid nae be. The woman was glad to get off when she heard Jamie  Speak in such a sensible manner.  The following will 6e fouad to contain many true statements, relative  to the horrgc atrocity committed hy that more than monslerotis  villain, and blood-thirsty savage, Burke. aizd his hell-hound  Associates, in the murder of zhis harmless youth.  It is probable that he had been for some time watched by this  gang of murderers, and marked out as one that might be erssilp  taken off  tithout suspicion. He was met by Burke about nine  o'clock one morning in October last, wandering about the Grass.  market. He instantly accosted him in a fawning manner, and inquired  of him where he was going ? Jamie told him, he was going  to seek his mother, to whom he was warmly attached. The wretch  saw at once that he now had him within his grasp. He contrived to  persuade him that he knew where his mother was, and that he would  take him to the place ; and by coxing and flattering, heat length decoyed  him into Hare's hovel, or rather den, solely for the purpose of  murderingand selling him to the Surgeons for dissection. Jamie, poor  fellow, had no sooner entered their horrid cave, than those manstcrs  of iniquity pretended to fecl the greatest kindness for him,

Burke, impatient to accomplish his object, suddenly  threw himself upon Jamie, and attempted to strangle him ;  Which roused the poor creature, and, muddled as he was with  liquor and sleep, he, by a dreadful effort, threw Burke off and got to  his feet, when a desperate slruggle ensued : Jamie fought with the  united frenzy of madbless and despair. Burke would have been  overpowered, had not Hare rushed forward and tripped up Jamie's  heels, and then dragged him along the floor, with Burke lying above  him; after which, both the ruffans got upon him, and at length,  though not even then dithdut the greatest difficulty, succeeded in  strangling him.  The Public papers subsequently state that this account of James'  murder is incorrect, for Burke, since his imprisonment, declares that  Hare began thc struggle with him4 and they fell and rolled together  on the floor, then Burke went to Hare's assistance, and they  at length finished him, though with much difficulty.  I t is reported, that during the struggle with these inhuman  butchers, that Jamie bit Burke so violently on his legs and in dif.  ferent parts of his body, that it is supposed, if the laws of his injured  coantry had not ptoziised to hang him up by the neck, he  would most likely die, for his wounds have carrcered from the  violent gnaws he received.

It is remarked in the Weekly Journal, dated January 7, 1829,  that one of the students recognised the subject to be Jamie the moment  he saw it, and that he had seen him alive and in health only  two days before. Jamie coald nbt fail to be recognised by most of  them, though hc had wanted the head, for his feet were very large,  rough, and a great many warts on them by not wearing shoes.  If any of them hod been possessed of the smallest feeling, they  would have given notice to the Captain of Police, by an anonymous  letter, of what they had witnessed. Had a dead dog been recognised  on the table, the effect produced, for all that we can learn,  could not have been more lightly forgotten.  Jamie was once interrogated, Why the Ladies in general did not  carry Bibles to Church ?   Because,  said Jamie, 'L they are  ashamed o' themsel's, for they canna fin' out the text.    That is  very true,  said an auld Dominie,   for I obkerved twa governesses  sitting in a front seat in zi church that I was in last Sabbath, and  the text was in Ecclesiastes, and neither of them could find it out.   It is most astostshing to 0 b     hrohw many there are, of both  sezes, that are at such a loss in turning up the text ; tlzere may be  some snzall exczsse for the lower classes of people who have not had a  liberal education,  z tth ere can be none for those who have learned  more languages tharz their or   The Ladies are too fona of folks,  That they may have a talk-  Than to perplex their minds with Woks  They'd rathd have a walk.

Nae, I'll no' drink wi' ye the non,  For if I div 'twill make me fou ;   'L Tush, man, a vee will do ye guid,  'Twill cheer yer Ireart, and warm yer bluid.   At last he took the fatal glass,  Not dreaming what would come to pass ;  When once he drank, he wanted more-  Till drunk he fell upon the floor.  '' Now,  said th' assassin,   now we may  Seize on him as our lawful prey.    ' Wait, wait,  said Hare, '' ye greedy assr  He's yet too strong-let's tak' a glass.   Like some unguarded gem he lies-  The vulture waits to seize his prize ;  Nor does he dream he's in his power,  Till it has seized him to devour.  The ruffian dogs,-the hellish pair,-  The villain Burke,-the meagre Hare,-  Impatient were the prize to win,  So to their smothering pranks begin :-

            <pagetext>13  Burke cast himself on Jamie's face,  And clasp'd him in his foul embrace ;  But Jamie waking in surprize,  Writhed in an agony to rise.  At last, with nerves unstrung before,  He threw the monster on the floor;  And though alarm'd, and weakn'd too,  He would have soon o'ercome the foe ;  But help was near-for it Burke cried,  And soon his friend was at his side ;  Hare tripp'd up Jamie's heels, and o'er  We fell, alas   to rise no more    Now both these blood-hounds him engage,  As hungry tygers till'd with rage,  Nor did they handle axe or knife,  To take am ay Daft Jamie's .ife.  No sooner done, than in a chest  They cramm'd this lately welcom'd guest,  And bore him into Surgeons' Square-  A subject fresh-a victim rare    And soon he's on the table laid,  Expos'd to the dissecting blade ;  But where his members now may lay  Is not for me-or you-to say.  But this I'll say-some thoughts did rise :  It till'd the Students with surprise,  That so short time should intervene  Since Jamie on the streets was seen.  But though his body is destroy'd,  His son1 can never be decoy'd  Prom that celestial state of rest,  Where he, I trust, is with the bless'd.

MRS. WILSON'S LAMENTATION, ON HEARING OF THE  CRUEL MURDER OF HER SON.  WHY didst thou wander from my side,  My joy, my treasure, and my pride?  Though others little thought of thee,  Thou wert a treesure dear tq me.  I little thought when thee I left,  So soon of thee to be bereft ;  Or that when after me you sought  You would by ruffian men be caught.  Thy playful manners fill'd with joy  The aged sire and sportive boy ;  Of real joy you had enough,  When you could give or take a snuff.  The tricks you phj'd with childish art,  Bound you the closer te my heprt ;  Thy kindness to thy mother prov'd  How dearly she by thee was lov'd.  What horrid mqnsters were those men  Who Iiir'd thee to their fatal den ;  That den, where deeds as yet utltold,  Were done for sake of sordid gold.  But they alone were not to blame ;  For when these dauntless monsters came  With human creatures scarcely cold,  The Doctom took them, we are told.  Nor did they leave the Doctor's door  Without an order to Bring more    But Justice stem aloud doth c*y,  . '  Let all who wkk at rnurdcn die

            <pagetext>1;  btrd justice shall to me he done,  On all who murder'd my poor son ;-    1'11 make appeal to Britain's King,  That one and all of them may swing.  But that will not restore my son,  Or remedy the mischief done ;  IIe murder'd is-no peace I have,  I shall go mourning to my gravc. -  AN ACROSTIC.    .TOIN with me, friends,whilst I bewail  Awhile the subject of this Tale ;  Many a mind has often been  Engaged with Jamie's awkward mien ;  Such pranks will ne'er again be seen.  We may bewail, but 'tis in vain,  I t will not bring him back again :  Lost he is now-this thought imparts  Sad comfort to our wounded hearts;  Oh   may such crimes nowhere remain,  Nor ever more our ou-r nation stain.  The Editor of this pamphlet, is glad to state, that a subscription  has been set on foot fpr the puryoae of conferring on Gray a  hdis  a ife, a lasting mark of public gratityde ; they being the means of  bringing to I glit he varied details of t h   sh orrid slaughter-house;  nor w llth e Edinburgh Public fail to patronize those meretorious  persons deserving as they certainly are of holding a better station  in soc ety than that in which they have hitherto been placed; no  6ooner had they detected the last victim of murdering cruelty,  than they gave information in the proper quarter openly, and  frankly, declared all they knew, and, so by their discoveries, the  partics concerned in this trade of murder were speedily arrested, and  now await the issue of that scrutiny, which will bring to light, as  thc noon day, their manifold and unparalelled deeds of darkness.

            <pagetext>I6  The Editor achndwlcdges the mans o )ligations under which the  Public has placed him, in their communications; bat as he would  not willingly give bffence to any ind vidual, he has been necessitated  to withhold from the Public, for the present, many very valuable  pieccs, both in pooiry and prose ; but he pledges himscii, as soon  as possiblc, to bring before the Public those pieces which he approves,  and which, he hopes, will meet with the Public approbation.  The communication of our Classical friend Sawney Bean, to his  learned friend W llieS mith, cannot at present be brought forward,  till some few anticipated circumstances take place. All future corn.  munications will be gladly rcceived by the Editor, No. 3, Bristo  Port; and he pledges himself, that no pains shall be wanting, on  his part, to secure the patronage of his friends.  Though new in my projects, I would not offend  That person who shews himself to be a friend,  But I will  cbuffa ll that gives me alarm,  Or that which )nay prove Caledonia's harm.  Shortly will be published, by the same Editor, price One Shilling,  (containing 64 pages of letter-press,) an Authentic Narrative  of the Life and Death of ROBERT KIRKWOOD, better known by  the name of BOUY AWL, an Idiot who strolled about Auld Reekie.  N. B. The Work  vill be embellished with Six Portraits of Boby ;  the one fronting the title will be Boby standing with a skellet  hanging hefore him, (by way of a drum,) with a sheep's foot in the  one hand and a large bone in the other.  *,* The Work will be very cntertsining to any who may read  it, though they never saw the Oaf. There will be nothing inserted  to cffend or corrupt the morals, so that an abbess or modeot damsel  may peruse it without blushing.  FINIS.

      <description>BURKE, THE MURDERER.    It would seem that Helen M'Dougal, the paramour  of Burke the murderer (and who gave origin to the  word "burking"), was living in New South Wales  until the other day, when she was accidentally burnt  to death at Singleton. Such was the information, at  all events, conveyed by telegraph from Sydney to  Melbourne on the 13th of last August. It is stated in  the message that the miserable woman was sent out  many years ago to the colony in which she has at length  come to a tragic end. It may be added that her maiden  name was Dougal. Burke met with her shortly after  she became a widow, in a rural part of Stirlingshire,  where he was working as a labourer on a canal. This  happened a few years before he and Hare engaged in  that fearful series of murders in the West Port of  Edinburgh which made their names for ever infamous.  Helen was tried along with Burke before the High  Court of Justiciary in 1828; and, thanks to the powerful  pleading of her counsel, Henry Cockburn, she  escaped the doom which overtook her partner in crime.  The verdict in her case was one of "Not proven," and  on hearing these words from the foreman of the jury,  Burke turned to her, and said, "Nelly, you are out of  the scrape." No one had, or could have, any doubt as  to her guilt; and the jury incurred a great deal of  blame for their verdict. From the condemned cell  Burke sent his watch and what money he possessed to  M'Dougal, saying, "Poor thing, it is all I have to  give her; it will be of some use to her, and I will not  need it."  On her liberation from prison she returned  to her old haunts, and being at once recognised, was  set upon and narrowly escaped death at the hands of  the mob. She afterwards left secretly for the village  where Burke first found her, but she had also to flee  from it, and nothing has since been heard of her until  now, when this story of her death comes from the  Antipodes. She must have been upwards of seventy  years old when she died. Burke was executed at  Edinburgh on the 16th of February, 1829. </description>

      <description>WILLIAM BURKE,-- A New Song.    Come all you resurrection men, I pray you now beware,  You see what has happened William Burke, and likewise William Hare.  Hare he kept a lodging house, it was in the West Port;  Where all kinds of travelers unto it did resort.  He lodged all both great and small, as truth to you I'll tell,   Till at last he began to murder them, to the Doctors for to sell.  The first was Margaret Paterson, as I did hear them say,  A young girl in the cannongate, that drink has led astray.  This William Burke fell in with her, and soon she did agree,  With him to go, but little knew that her butcher we would be.  The next was poor Daft Jamie, as I did hear them say,  That often on the street with hairns used to play/  To the Fleshmarket he often did resort,The fleshers all being kind to him,  For with him they had good sport  And the bakers all, both great and small, with him did well agree,  Although that he was void of sense, right innocent was he.  But one day as Jamie walked all along upon the street,  With these two body snatchers he chanced for to meet  Then Burke showed him some money, and said Jamie come away,  And like Judas with our Saviour this lamb they did betray.  they went into a silent place and got this murder done,  The next was an old woman that came to seek her son.  He was a soldier and in the Castle lay,  And Burke saw her a stranger, and soon did her betray.  He said, I keeo lodgings, and come along with me,  And you shall be well used, and that you soon shall see  He showed a bed and said to her, mistress, you'll lye there,  And you will get soon asleep, before it be morning clear  Now she has took off her clothes, and went into her rest,  But she little knew the secret that was within their breast  And now then she gathered, and soon to work they fell  And they murdered this old woman, and to the doctors did her sell;  And now they got this over, and thought that all was set,  But down come the police, and taken they were at last  And now before the bar of Justice they did appear,  But Hare and his wife turned evidence themselves for to clear  Now Burke received his sensence, and is sent back to the Jail  Now he lies to morn his wretched case,  And Hair should be ihere if right does take place.  And for these women they should be burnt for such a murder,                  Written by John Logan!! </description>

      <description>The Wesport Murders.    A NEW SONG.      A story, a story I'm going for to tell,  Concerning William Burke that now lies in Jail.  A few verses of his cruelty I mean for to sing,  You know he committed the worst of all crimes.    For a twelve month and more he carried on this way,  And many a poor victim his bloody hands did destroy.  In the midst of all the horror there was none did him forget  But you know he'll be rewarded on the twenty-eight.        The poor girl Patterson, the first that we do hear,  He murdered this creature in the midst of his carreer,  He mangled her body but yet she found no grave,  But we hope that still her poor soul has been saved.    Daft Jamie was the next, or James Wilson by name,  That they did decoy into their bloody den;  While in search of his mother, Burke did him betray,  Like a lamb to the slaughter he led him away.    Mrs Docherty, or Campbell, from Glasgow did come,  It was her intention to look for her son,  The bloody hound he spied her and did her deceive,  He pretended great friendship which she did believe.    Home to his house this woman he did take,  And ordered his mistress her breakfast to make;  They said that she was his friend, but mark now, I pray,  With what cruelty and bloodshed he this victim did     slay.    All you that doth read these few lines that I make,  When I think upon Burke it doth make my hesat ache.  James Wilson for his mother looked, and Campbell for     her son,  And you see by his flattery they both were undone. </description>

      <description>The Recent Murders.    A NEW SONG.  Tune,---"Chevy Chase"      God Prosper long our noble king,    Our lives and safeties all  I'll sing of murders that till now,    did never yet befal.    In modern Athens as it's call'd,    In wester Portsburgh Street,  Two murderers had their horrid den,    And there did nightly meet.    These wretches names were Burke and Hare,    Both from the sister isle,  Their plan was to take strangers in,    And them of life beguile.    Which having done, they wrapped them up,    Then laid them in a box,  And without either dread or fear,    Sold them to Doctor K----.    The first was Margaret Paterson,    Who drink had led astray,  She fell into their wicked hands,    who chok'd her as she lay.    Next on the list was Daft Jamie,    Who laugh'd and sung nae crouse,  And seeking his mother was decoy'd    Into the murderers house.    Where they with whiskey plied him hard,    Till he was nearly fu',  Then Burke engaged him instantly,    And Jamie down di pu'.    But he at last with unstrung nerves,    Would soon have manag'd Burke,  Had not the fiendish Hare come in    And finished the work.    Next was a wife who came to town    In search of her dear son,  Was by these wicked wretches dogg'd,    And barbarously undone.    Last Burke has seiz'dan infant dear,    Oh! horrible disgrace,  Who, while he chock'd it on his knee,    Did smile up in his face.    Such are the horrid deads of Burke,    Deeds never done before,  Who since his sentence has confess'd    To twenty murders more.    His trusty friend, the wicked Hare,    Now waits alike his fate,  And tho' vengeance is often slow,    It never comes too late.    Now all ye powers that rule above,    Grant we may evil shun,  And that henceforth such dreadful acts,    May never more be done! </description>

      <description>ELEGIAC LINES  ON THE  Tragical Murder  OF  POOR DAFT JAMIE.      ATTENDANCE give, whilst I relate  How poor Daft Jamie met his fate;  'Twill make your hair stand on your head,  As I unfold the horrid deed :-    That hellish monster, Williiam Burke,  Like Reynard sneaking on the lurk,  Coyduck'd his prey into his den,  And then the woeful work began :-    "Come, Jamie, drink a glass wi' me,  And I'll gang wi' ye in a wee,  To seek yer mither i' the town-  Come drink, man, drink, an' sit ye down."    "Nae, I'll no' drink wi' ye the nou,  For if I div 'twill mak' me fou ;"  "Tush, man, a wee will do ye guid,  "Twill cheer yer heart, an' warm yer bluid."    At last he took the fatal glass,  Not dreaming what would come to pass ;  When once he drank, he wanted more-  Till drunk he fell upon the floor.    "Now," said th' assassin, "now we may  Seize on him as our lawful prey."  "Wait, wait," said Hare, "ye stupid ass,  He's yet too strong-let's tak' a glass."    Like some unguarded gem he lies----  The vulture waits to seize its prize ;  Nor does he dream he's in its power,  Till it has seized him to devour.    The ruffian dogs,-the hellish pair,-  The villain Burke,-the meagre Hare,-  Impatient were the prize to win,  So to their smothering pranks begin :-    Burke cast himself on Jamie's face,  And clasp'd him in his foul embrace ;  But Jamie waking in surprise,  Writhed in an agony to rise.    At last, with nerves unstrung before,  He threw the villain on the floor ;  And though alarm'd, and weaken'd too,  He would have soon o'ercome the foe :    But help was near-for it Burke cried,  And soon his friend was at his side ;  Hare tripp'd up Jamie's heels, and o'er  He fell, alas ! to rise no more !    Now both these blood-hounds him engage,  As hungry tygers fill'd with rage,  Nor did they handle axe or knife,  To take away Daft Jamie's life.    No sooner done, than in a chest  They cramm'd this lately welcom'd guest,  And bore him into Surgeons' Square-  A subject fresh victim rare !    And soon he's on the table laid,  Expos'd to the dissecting blade ;  But where his,members now may lay  Is not for me-or you-to say.    But this I'll say some thoughts did rise :  It fill'd the Students with surprise,  That so short time should intervene  Since Jamie on the streets was seen:    But though his body is destroy'd,  His soul can never be decoy'd  From that celestial state of rest,  Where he, I trust, is with the bless'd.    Written by J. P. -    N.B.-There will be published on Monday first, by the same Editor, a LACONIC NARRATIVE  of the LIFE and DEATH of POOR JAMIE to which will be added, a few Anecdotes  relative to him, and his old friend BOBY AWL:- PRICE THRIP PENCE. The work  will be embellished with a striking Portrait of Jamie.    Published by WILLIE SMITH,No.3, Bristo Port,    PRICE ONE PENNY </description>

      <description>Poor Jamie ne'er was shrowded,  But in a Tea-chest crowded ;  With Coffin ne'er connected,  But by the knife dissected."    Jamie Wilson's Mother's Dream.      Dark, dark, and drizzly was the night,  And lang, lanq, after gloamin',  When Jamie's Mother lonely sat,  His absence sair bemoanin'.    What keeps ye Jamie out sae late,  In this unwholesome weather ?  O haste ye hame, and ease the mind  Of your auld anxious Mother.    Dim gleams the lamp of this late hour,  The embers faintly burning,  Before your Mother, lone and poor,  Wha waits on your returning.    One night I dream'd a dreary dream,  To think on't makes me shiver,-  I thought I heard my Jamie scream,  0 help me, help me, Mother !    Methought I ran to help my bairn,  But never could win near him,-  Methought his voice still weaker grew,  Till I could scarcely hear him ;    And as he vanieh'd from my view,  Methought 1 heard him crying,  Farewell ! ye cannot help me now,  Your Jamie Wilson's dying.    I wandered to your father's grave,  A place I visit often;  Methoughts I  saw a corseless shroud,  Beside an empty coffin.    I saw stern Justice fast approach,  Dire Judgeent seem'd to follow  I woke and found my aching head,  Reclin'd on my lone pillow.    Since then, my nights have sleepless been,  My days are spent in mourning;  Nae longer hopes I entertain  Of Jamie e'er returning.    My bark is on lifes ocean toss'd,-  My Jamie's safe;y landed,  I'll meet him on yon peaceful coast,  His powers of mind expanded.    His vacant e'e, his temper mild,-  His unobtrusive silence;  A general fav'rite made my child,  And yet he fell by violence.    No curse I on you fiends invoke,  Reflections will torment them ;  From giving others such a shock,  Good Lord of Heaven prevent them.    Braes of the Curse, Handsel Monday.       A. Gowrie.    K.B.-There is published by the same Editor, (the second Edition, with alterations,)  a LACONIC NARRATIVE of the LIFE and DEATH of POOR JAMIE; in, which are interspersed,   several Anecdotes relative to him, and his old friend BOBY AWL :-PRICE THRIP PENCE.   The work is embellished with a striking Portrait of Jamie.  Published by W. SMITH. No, 3, Bristo Port </description>

      <description>William Burk's    Execution.  Let old and young unto my song a while attention pay,  The news I'll tell will please you well, the monster Burke's away,  At the head of Libberton Wynd  he finished his career,  There's few, I'm sure, rich or poor, for him would shed a tear.                               Chorus.    Now Burke, the mnrderer, is dead, his troubles here are o'er,  We can't tell where his spirit's fled, he'll Burke the folk no more.    Eighteen hundred and twenty-nine, let it recorded be,  Twenty-eight day of January he suffer'd on a tree.  To Edinbro', numbers did go, that day before 'twas noon,  For to see Burke, that cruel Turk, receive his awful doom;    They brought him from the Calton Jail, some time in the night  They thought the crowd would do the job had they waited til light,  From the Lock-up they brought Burk out about the hour of eight  Where about forty-thousand folk impatiently did wait.    The injur'd crowd, they groaned aloud;-this monster to behold,  who in his time had thought no crime to murder young and old,  When the scaffold he did ascend, the people all did cry,  Bring out Will Hare, we think it fair, that he also should die,    As round his neck the rope it went, the shout; did rend the sky,  its "Burk him, Burk him," the blood-hound, the people all      did cry.  The shouts they did continue on, until he was cut down,  The like was never heard before in Edinbro' town.    His bloody den, it does remain, for strangers to behold,  Where him and Hare, they did not spare the lives of young ans      old,  In memory his bones will be preserv'd for years to come,  Ye Burkites! now beware, lest you do meet with the same      doom. </description>

      <description>MANSIE WAUGH'S DREAM,  CONCERNING THE  Execution of Burke,  PART FIRST.     "MY old and faithful servant, Tommy Bodkin,  had been long Thomas Bodkin, Master Tailor in  Dalkeith, but removed to Edinburgh, where, by his  skill in the craft, for which he owns himself indebted  to me, he has acquired great fame as a Fashionable  Tailor, and has a fair prospect of being Deacon  to the Corporation. About the New-year he brought  out Mrs Bodkin in a chaise, on a visit to and  my Nanse at Lugton. A' the cracks in town and  country being about the West-Port Murders, we naturally  fell upon that subject. Mr Bodkin minded  what I thought of the Irishers langsyne. " But  did you ever think it would come to this ?" said he.  Mrs Bodkin said, " Mr Wauch, you have never  come to see us in Edinburgh, ye maun positively  come and see the fair last show of that monster  Burke; our house is in the Lawnmarket, and ye'll  get a fine sight frae the windows; ye'll take the  coach the night before, and get a bed with us : I  winna take a refusal."     "I am very doubtful whether I could stand sir  an awfu' sight, for I canna thole to see our Nanse  draw a chuckie's neck for our Sunday's dinner," said  I ; a yet he is sic a monster, in the shape of a man,  that I think I could see him wagging in a tow, with  something like satisfaction."     To make a long tale short, I took my seat in the  coach, and found Mr Bodkin waiting to meet me at  the office : he led me up the street on his arm, and  expressed himself more than happy to see his honoured  master at his fire-side. I cannot describe the  grandeur of their house; mahogany chairs and tables,  carpets and window-curtains, looking,glasses,  and what not, every thing more prejinct than  another. Losh me sic grandeur for Mansie Waugh's  'prentice. As a proof of how the public feel about  that bloody business-they told me they were offering  a guinea for every one who could Sit at their windows  and see the execution, but they preferred  obliging their friends and customers. After a fine  supper, I got a grand bed, it might have served a  Duke ; but I could not sleep for thinking about the  unhappy wretch-I had a kind of dover, but wakened  eerie, and was glad at heart when I saw the light  of day. But, losh me ! when I went to the window  and looked to the street, from tbe Tron Kirk to the  Castle-hill, nothing but a sea of heads, and every  window full where they could get a glint of the gallows;  and, I said, "I never saw the marrow of  that, except when the King was here; I find it is  the same in the first sight of a monarch whom we  love, and a monster whom we hate."-" That's a  sensible observe," said a lady, quoting something,  which I think she said from Shakspeare. There  now rose a hurrah, which seemed to rend the air,  and we saw the wretch coming up Libberton's Wynd,  Before he appeared, I thought I could lend a hand  to tear him in pieces; but now that he was before  me, and I thought in how short a time he would be  in eternity, and his doom sealed for ever, my heart  grew sair and dunted in my bosom. When he  mounted the scaffold, my head became dizzy.-I saw  the rope put about his neck-my een dazzled-the  napkin fell-I heard anither hurrah-I saw his legs  wagging-a cloud came over my sight, and I coupit  back in the floor aa dead's a maw ! I canna say how  lang I was in the swarf, nor what passed ; but when  I came to mysel', a fine lady was holding a wee  gowd box to my nose, and Mrs Bodkin, washing my  brow wi' cauld water. But in a little time there  rose up anither wild hurrah, which made the flesh  on my bones creep : I felt the dwawm like to come  o'er me again, when they told me the body was cut  down and the crowd dispersing.       They now set the breakfast, and it was a weel  covered table ; that a Provost's couldna been better:  there was ham, eggs, and finnan haddies, biscuits  and buttered toast, honey and jelly, tea and coffee,  and several things that I didna ken the names o';  but, for a' the temptations, ne'er a bit would gang o'er  my craig.-I grew sick, and had to leave the table,  passing a dreary day in bed, where I could think of  nothing but Burke: I got a' gliff o' sleep about  gloamin', and the sloom refreshed me wonderfully ;  for I wakened about nine o'clock, as hungry as a  hawk. When I came into the parlour, I met half a  dozen o' gentlemen, who Mr Bodkin said, were a'  fain to see me. I found they had a' read my volume  ; they paid me many compliments, comparing  me to authors of whom I had never heard, and saying   that my name would gang down to distant ages.     When we met in the dining-room, there was a  supper set in grand style, the very sight of it made  my mouth water, for I had fasted for near four and twenty  hours. There was flesh and fish, cooked in  various ways, with sauces and pickles, pastry and  fruits that I had never seen the like of; Alloa ale  and London porter, Holland and French brandy for  drams; and when we had made a hearty supper,  we had two bowls of punch, one of Glenlivet whisky,  and anither of Jamaica rum. My health was the  first toast after the King's , and it was drunk with sic'  a clapping o' hands and clattering o' heels, I kenn'd  na' how t' look. They then drank the Corporation  of Tailors, of which they said I was the most cele-  brated member except Ferdinand of Spain, who  made a petticoat for the Virgin Mary. " But that  doesna make him a talior-he's but a manty-maker  at the best," said I, which produced a hearty laugh.     We then began to crack about the murders; and  they a' spake their minds about Burke and his gang,  of which they considered Dr Knox a distinguished  member. The verdict of the jury upon M'Dougal  was a ferly to one and a' o' the company ; and they  didna hesitate to say, that Mr Cockburn drew the  blade o'er their een, and glamoured their gumption,  by dint of what they termed sophistical reasoning.  Even those who hold their heads high in office were  not spared,-the refusing to let Borbe make a full  confession, and not permitting him to be seen, was  bitterly spoken of. The diposting the turnkey for  disclosing the secrets "of the prison-house," they  said had a strange appearance ; and it looked like  as if some folks were fonder of availing themselves  of the quibbles of the law, than of the administration  of strict justice. It was a bungled job at the  best ; for, instead of probing the foul sair to the bottom,  they wished to skin over the deep wound which  humanity a d the honour of Edinburgh had received.  &amp;c "Hout, man," said anither; " there's reasons for  every thing, and there's wheels within wheels mair  than you think of."  "That maybe," said the first ;  "but such conduct by some winna be soon forgotten,  and I wonder they can sleep sound in their beds,  considering the clamour against them, and the state  of the public mind."               TO BE CONTINUED.  Published by W. Smith, No. 3, Bristo Port.</description>

      <description>A MANSIE WAUGH'S DREAM,  Concerning the Execution  of  BURKE.  PART SECOND.     We had a long jolly night of it, but my head  began spinning like a peerie, and I thought a' the  room rinning round about, when Mrs Bodkin kindly  bade her gudeman take me to my bed. It was a  considerable time before I could sleep, for though  we had been a' hearty and happy, I thought I saw,  Burke just at the fatal moment between time and  eternity, and the wild unearthly yells of the multitude  still rang in my lugs. Howsoever, at length  and lang I fell asleep, but, Heaven preserve me frae  sic anither night ! For I had a dream so dreadful,  that it excelled a' I ever heard or read of. There's  a chapter in my book called "The Awfu' Night,"  but that is but mere mockery to what I suffered on  this occasion, and I wadna wish my greatest enemy  mair punishment, than a dream as dreadful as mine.  I shall set down some particulars, but it defies a' the  powrers of my pen to describe its horrors, and there  may be some thngs inconsistent like, but the reader  will keep in mindd it was a dream.       I thought I had been bousin' wi' some o' the Professors  o' the College, and was comin' doun the  West Port, when my head grew dizzy and heart sick, '  which caused me to lean my back to the wa'. I  thought a man came to me and got me wheedled to  take haud o' his arm an' gang wi' him to his house or  I got better ; I could nae speak to him, but, like a  simpleton, I went with him, and he led me in a  dark close, where we entered a weirdless like house ;  and when I looked at him in the light, Gude gracious  ! my heart died within me, for I kent him to  be Burke ! and the wrech M'Dugal, with anither  man, (the wretch Hare,) were sitting at the fireside,  my blood ran cauld in my veins-I thought my  heart grippit like as if it had been screwed in a  smith's vice; every hair in my head stood up like  green rashes in a bog; my flesh creepit on my bones;  and believing my last hour was come, I said to myself,  "Lord, have mercy on my soul !" Hare left  the house, and I thought it was for no good. How-  ever, I sought a drink o' water, and that brought  me round a wee, and I began to think it possible,  by the help of God, to ehcape : I took out a schilling,  and said to Burke, "If you could get half a mutchkin  of good whiskey, I think a dram would recover  me:" thinking if I got one out, I would try to  manage the other. Burke went for the whisky, and  just when I was rising. the she-devil came behind  me, ragged me by the coat-tail back owre on the   floor, and in a second of time was lying above my  breast, with a weight like a millstone, her one hand  on my mouth and the other at my thrapple, so that  I had no power to cry. Another minute would have   done the job, but I thought if I could fenzie being   dead, she would maybe rise; so I turned up my een,  and shot out my legs, like one in the dead-thraws,  and there I lay seemingly dead as a herring.  The hag had me stripped skin-naked ere any one  came in. Hare was the first with a long muckle  kist; thinks I, that's my coffin. They coupit me  into it without difficulty, for I'm a little man, and  before Burke came in the lid was closed. He sat  down on it with the whiskey, and, by a merciful Pro-  vidence, his weight dang a hole in it, which let in  air to keep me alive. They agreedt' get a porter  directly, as Dr Knox was waiting, and had promised  to pay them that night.     In a situation like mine, minutes were like months  in duration ; and I wearied sair for the porter ; for I  had once dined with Dr Knox, and had some hope  that, if I were beside him, I had a fair chance for  my life, if I had pith and power to dunt upon the  kist-lid. Wee], the porter came, got a dram, and  was told to bring back the kist immediately, as they  had occasion for it that night. I was hoisted on his  back, and he trudged at a quick step. The kist was  carried directly into the dissecting room ; Burke,  Hare, Dr Knox, and Paterson, a' present, and I was  laid on the dissecting.table. Glad was I to breathe  the air, though it was neither sweet nor fresh, for  there was a fearful ugsome smell. The bruits got  ten pounds as the price of my blood, and Dr Knox  pushed them out. When they were gone, he looked  steadfastly in my face with a candle, and said,  "David, this is Mansie Wauch, the Tailor in Dal-  keith, who is the author of the curious book that we  were reading the other night; he is an original, he  has made more noise in the world than all the fraternity  of Tailors from the earliest generations; his scull  alone is worth ten guineas to any Phrenological Lec-  turer: when they went away they locked the door,  and left me in the dark with so many instruments  of death around me, that a cauld sweat stood on every  pore of my skin. When I reflected that he had paid  ten pounds for my carcase, and counted upon get.  ting ten guineas for my harn-pan, my hopes in his  mercy vanished like the morning dew. I thought I  was only out o' the frying-pan into the fire, as  we say, frae the de'il to the deep sea. I thought  upon Nanse, left a sorrowful, forlorn widow, and  my body hashed and slashed with their bloody  knives. However, I tried to put up a petition to  Him wha hears always, and from whom no darkness  can hide ; and I said, " Lord, in thy mercy,  hear and deliver me from this man of blood-this  uncircumcised Philistine !"     The Doctor came in with a candle, looking for  something; he took up legs and arms, whistling a'the  time quite carelesly. I cou'dna tell my feelings--  they defy expression. However, I thought the Doc-  ter was an honourable man; and I felt, that if ever  there was a chance of getting out o' the glede's grips,  now was the time ; so I mustered a' my strength,  and roared out " Murder-murder ! I'm Burked,    floor, niirt in a seco:id of' time was lyinz allove my '   but I ainna be Knoxed-Murder !" The awfu'  consternation I was in made me try to rise; and I  thought I rowed aff the table, playing thump on the  floor. The fall wakened me from my dream, but I  didna ken where I was, till Mr and Mrs Bodkin  came rinning up with a light, and found me spraw-  ling on the carpet, and looking as wild as a wild cat.  It wasna an easy job for them to convince me I was  safe, and make me sensible of my situation, and I  wasna mysel' for four-and-twenty hours after.-At  the moment I write this, my heart dunts, and the  blood rins cauld in my body. Some folk may say  there's nae rationality in the thing, but we canna  aye command our waking thought and manna expect  reason in a dream,"                (CONCLUDED.)Published by W.SMITH, No.3, Bristo Port.</description>

      <description>"In Scotland, the Slaughter-house-keeper may pay  His Journeymen Butchers, and thrive on his prey :  The victims are quickly cut up in his shop,  And he pockets the profits, secure from the drop.    In Edina town, where your friend you may meet,  At morning, in health,  walking forth in the street;  And, at evening, decoy'd and depriv'd of his life,  His corpse fresh and warm is laid out for the knife."    A TIMELY HINT  TO  ANATOMICAL PRACTITIONERS,  AND THEIR  Associates-the Resurrectionists.    A NEW SONG-Tune, Macpherson's Farewell.    WHAT is our land at last come to?    Our ancestors would weep,  And say, with many, were they here,  " Look well before ye leap !"    Ye prowling Resurrectionists    Of every clime and shore,  Remember Burke, that smoth'ring wretch,    For he is now no more.    This monster, with his meagre chief,    In actions mean and low,  Resolv'd to rid the land of all    That wander'd to and fro.    Two buxom females, with those brutes,    In this work had their share :-  One party coax'd them to the den,    The other slew them there.    They with the greatest kindness wiled    Daft Jamie off the street,  Whose playful manners did delight    All that he chanced to meet.    With Judas smiles they did betray    The aged Dougherty ;  Who wander'd long from door to door    In search of charity.    M'Dougal, Paterson, and more,    Were by those fiends beguil'd ;  Nor did they shudder to destroy    The helpless smiling child.    Men, women, children, old and young,    The sickly and the hale,  Were murder'd, pack'd up, and sent off    To K---- 's human sale.    That man of skill, with subjects warm,    Was frequently supplied ;  Nor did he question when or how    The persons brought had died !    If he want subjects let him try    From France to get them o'er;  For he can get them, when he will,    Sent at Six pounds the score.    Or let him try some legal means    His subjects to obtain ;  Nor ever more in word or deed    Wink at such tricks again.    One of the tribe has met his fate    On gibbet high and strong ;  And if such pranks are play'd again,    The rest will swing e'er long !                             Written by WAG PHIL.    A Second Edition is published, of the Life and Death of JAMES WILSON, known by the  name of DAFT JAMIE.-Price THRIP Pence.  The rapid sale of the First Edition of this work, together with the liberal criticisms  which have been passed on it, not only by the Editor's envious: accquaintances, but by  several of our Edinburgh Reviewers, render any further recommendation altogether unnecessary.  The autbor begs leave to submit the following as a specimine :-Extracted from  the Edinburgh Literary Journal, dated Jan. 24, 1889-'' It seems a work of inestimable  value."  The Work is embellished with a striking Portrait of Jamie. To be had of the Author,  W.Smith, 3 Bristo Port, and several Booksellers in Town and Country. </description>

      <description>William Burke's    MURDERS IN THE WESTPORT.    Ye people of Scotland give ear to this sad tale,  It, will make your hearts burn, and your faces turn pale,  Concerning a deed which has lately been,done,  the like was ne'er heard, of since the world begun,    Ia Edinburgh there lived a man and his wife,  In horrid transactions they passed their life,  Its deed after deed they did quickly persue,  No terror had they, nor a thought for to rue.    The first charge against them was of a dark hue,  But be it true or be it false hereafter will shew, .  Mary Paterson from Glasgow, her life it was ta'en.  without any cause but for real greed of gain    The next in this black list of crime, we hear,  Was a man of weak parts to humanity dear,  His name was James Wilson - how awful the thought,  It is said they did murder. though he sore with them fowl.    A third now appears in this blood stained scroll,  To wound every feeling and harrow the soul,  A poor widow woman in search of ber son,  Is waylaid, invited, and then quite undone .    To the house of this blood-hound, she asked for to rest,  Then they did treat her with drink not the best,  And while this state a sham scuffle began,  Between Burke the murderer, and one of his clan,    In this unmanly fight the woman she rose,  As well as she could, to stop the blows,  And while in this act she was knock'd to the floor,  And the women, to screen, then ran to the door.    The base hearted coward, whose name is called Hare,  As soon as he did it, Burke managed the snare.  He fell on her body, and stiffled her so,  That death it did follow, and forc'd blood it did flow    This scene being over, she quickly is laid,  And wrapped In straw is thrown under the               &lt;==[final word is gone but was probably "hay"]  And while is this state, the liquor goes round,  And nothing but mirth and full glasses abound.    Sometime after this her body is sent,  In charge of a porter by the parties consent  To the house of a Doctor ,who they knew would be found,  And for this horrid action received ten pound.    But Lo! while dividing their blood gotten gear,  What a sight does appal them I the Policemen appear,  Each countenance changes, when them they behold  The hearts that were glad are now cheerless and Cold    To the bar o justice they quickly are led,  To answer for innocent blood they had shed,  The man was convicted, the woman got clear,  But a troubled conscience she surely must bear    A crime, such as this, was ne'er heard in our land,  It makes the heart shudder, the hair straight to stand  to think that such murders for sake of a fee  By a Gang of Monsters committed should be.</description>

            <pagetext>To SIR WILLIAM RAE, BARONET,  His Majesty's Advocate for Scotland.    My Lord,     You are aware that, at this moment, the  public feeling is strongly excited against the  perpetrators of the late foul and cold blooded  murders that have taken place in the very centre  of a populous and civilized city. The exact  extent to which this traffic in blood has heen  carried on, and by whom, is yet a secret. Part  of the gang have been brought to light, and by  a strict investigation, I have no doubt but the  remainder may also be brought to condign punishment.  Your Lordship is aware, that in all  civilized nations, blood calls for blood. The  holy religion to which we subscribe, and the  God of all nature hath expressly said,   That  he who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his  blood be shed.  The late horrible traffic has  chilled every breast against the individuals, and  it only surprises the public that such a traffic

            <pagetext>should be carried on in the heart of a populous  city, and in so open a manner, without coming  to the knowledge of the men in power; in carefully  perusing this letter, your Lordship will  perceive, that at one period, when a just suspicion  fell upon Burke about the beginning of  October last, a policeman man stationed at his  door, but even then, he eluded their vigilance,  and the body was safely deposited in the Lecture  Room. Your Lordship will pardon me  for not making farther remarks, until I give  verbatim the words of some of the parties said  to have acted a conspicuous part in the tragedy.  My motives for setting the inquiry on foot  were these, viz:- To have a candid statement  from the individuals in the service of Dr Knox,  who must have known when and how they became  acquainted with Burke and Hare,-by  what means the bodies were procured; from  whence,-and by whom are the Anatomical  Schools supplied,-- who are the parties that  examine the bodies before dissection,-and if  there is any register of opinion kept respecting  them.     Your Lordship must be aware that the public  eye is fixed upon you, as public prosecutor,  and as the greater portion of that public is  ignorant of the regular routine and evidence

            <pagetext>required, before your Lordship can file a Bill  of Indictment, with any degree of certainty as  to its issue, and as it is a known trait in your  Lordship's character, to lean to the side of  mercy, yet, in this case, we trust you will  strain every nerve, and sift this dreadful plot  to its very core. I will now proceed to detail  P       n's own's words, which appears to me,  (especially as it is supported by other proofs),  to carry a considerable share of plausibility  along with it.     David P------n was first in the employment  of Dr K---- in the year 1824 or 1825, for  about one yeor, and on his return from the army  at the close of 1827, did apply to Dr K---- for  his former situation, and was engaged in the beginning  of February 1828, as the Museum  keeper; his salary was very small, but from the  fees paid him by the students, he contrived to  make a very comfortable livelihood. He had  nothing whatever to do with the subjects (or  bodies) brought to the Lecture Room, his sole  charge was to keep the Museum, and be answerable  for articles therein; at that time he  did not know how the Doctor obtained subjects.  But shortly after saw Burke and Hare, (Burke  was called John, and Hare William,) who had  brought a subject, and delivered it to Mr M-----r    B 2

            <pagetext>an assistant, who had the management of  that traffic, and from the conversation that then  passed, understood that they, (Burke and Hare)  had been in the habit of supplying Dr K---- with  subjects previous to that time.     During the lectures Burke or Hare, and  sometimes both, frequently called towards  evening, and informed Mr M-----r that they had  a subject for the Doctor, when Mr M----r would  accompany them, and return in the course of  an hour and a half, or thereabout, the Doctor  always desiring P--------n to be in the way  with the keys, as it would not do to keep the  parties waiting on their return, and that the  rooms should be kept open until they did return.  In this manner did they continue to  supply, or rather assist in supplying the Lecture  Room during the season, nothing particularly  occuring to his notice, until they had brought  a female suhject. Now, my Lord, mark his  own words,   Not being in the room when  the body was brought,---I found Mr M----r in  close conversation with Burke and Hare, and  a female subject streched upon the floor, the  beautiful symmetry and freshness of the body  attracted my attention; soon after I heard  Mr F----n, another assistant of Dr K----,  say that he was acquainted with the deceased,

Now, as I  remembered that I had positive orders from  the Doctor not to interfere at all with these  men, I was content to be silent.  To a question  put to P------n, whether he had any suspicion  of Burke and Hare, as to the manner  they had obtained the body of the female, or if

Answered, that he  had not the slightest suspicion as to the deceased  having met with a premature death,  but did think that it really was sold by the  relatives, or by same one who kept a brothel  or lodging house for paupers, from whom the  ressurrectionists purchase subjects; the only  remark he ever heard made by either the assistants  or students was; that it was a fine proportioned  body, and that she must have been a  very handsome woman, so much so indeed,  that many of the students took sketches of  it, one of which is is in his posession.     About this time it appears that Burke and  Hare became rather troublesome at tbe Doctor's  house, and he not being altogether over anxious  of such visitors,requested to know where they  lived, and finding that they resided in Portsburgh,  requested P------n, as his lodgings was  in Portsburgh also, to take any message for him  they might have, which he was to convey to  Newington, and return an answer, this he absolutely  refused, saying that he did not wish resurrectionists  to be coming about his lodgings,  but they ought to call at the Lecture Room;  this did not suffice, for either the Doctor, or  some one for him , had given P----'s address,

Me accordingly went to the  Doctor and received the money for them, not  at all pleased with the mission.     Previous to this period, Burke became  a patient of Dr K-----'s, and came to the  Lecture Room to have his wound dressed.  He disappeared for some time during harvest.  P------n being also from home during  the vacation, the rooms were under the care  of Mr Angus M----n. On his (P----n's)  return, he learned from (M----n) that Hare,  or William as he was called, had been there a  short time before with a subject, unattended  by Burke, but P------n could not say whether  it was male or female, as he did not see it,  and although he firmly believes it to be the  case-cannot vouch any father than M------n's  own words. When he again received the keys  from M----n, and when the Lectures were  about to commence, the Doctor made frequent  enquiries at his assistants if any of them had  seen John, (meaning Burke,) going about, and  requested P----n to find him out, and desire  him to call upon the Doctor. P-----n's enquiries  were fruitless; some time after Burke  called at the rooms to have the Doctor's opi-

The  Doctor and his assistants seemed glad of Burke's  visit, and he was earnestly requested by them  to resume his supplies of subjects as formerly.     Burke's confession, as stated in the Caledo-  nian Mercury, sets forth, that P----n had  frequently urged Burke and Hare to procure as  many subjects as possible P------n admits  that, on one occasion, he was requested by the  Doctor to desire John to get as many subjects  as possible as he would require all he could get;  but denies that he ever received any fee or reward  above his regular salary and students fees;  and that he had nothing to do with the procuring  of subjects, that being entirely the assistants'  duty, which another part of Burke's confession  fully corroborates, when he says, that he  Never sold a subject to any other person but  the Doctor or his assistants; and that he had  no more to do than leave the body at the  Rooms and go to the Doctor for the money.  Another proof that others were equally, if not  more culpable, than P-----n, is as follows:-  At the commencement of the Lectures in October  last, P -----n overheard a conversation,  rather in high words, between Mr F----n, one

Burlre having called at  the nick of time, I told him what the Doctor  had said, and in a few minutes he saw the Doctor  himself. The conversati011 was nearly as  follows : after Barke requesting the protection,  the Doctor said he had not got it yet ; but  that he (Burke) S I I O U I  b ring the box, and that  if lie, or those employed by him, were stopt upon  the street, they mere for their own personal  safety to suffer themselves to be taken to the  Police Office along with the package. In a  short time they would be relieved, and the  package would assuredly be sent to him from  the Office ; Burke's reply was, that if he was  once taken to the Police O ce he mould not so  easily get out again.   Did your Lordship ever hear this before ?-  Did such a statement come out upon Burke's  trial ? or, were such questions ever put to  P--n ? If this statement therefore is correct,  at:ii i ii: rmatiogniv en to the Police that n corpse

I say, why should not a  warrant have been granted to search the premises?   If this had been done, it might have  been the means of saving many victims that  afterwards fell into the hands of these bloodthirsty  miscreants. It may be asked, how  could the authorities prove that the individuals  were murdered ? seeing that even our professors  of anatomy could not perceive any thing  like external marks of violence, or symptoms  of an internal nature, to lead them for a moment  to suppose that the subjects heretofore  brought by Burke and Hare had met with a  premature death. I am inclined to think that  this part of the mystery has been overlooked,  not by any means imputing any blame to Dr  K---- or his assistants. But, Tyro, as I am  on matters of anatomy, I have always been  led to consider that suffocation or strangulation  causes the blood to flow to the head, consequently  makes the face of a strong livid colour,  with a small discharge of blood from the  mouth, nose, and ears. Now, as most of the  subjects produced by Burke and Hare had suf-      B

I  will ask any of the professors of anatomy, candidly  and honestly, that if two men, of the ap-  pearance of Burke and Hare, had brought  them ten or a dozen bodies, with the same ap-  pearance as those brought by B, and H. must  have had, what would be their opinion? I am  certain of one thing, that it would, at least, have  a great tendency to rouse their suspicions and,  make minute inquiries as to the manner they  obtained such subjects. But we are told that  Dr K---- did not know, nor had he the most  distant idea, that these subjects were any thing  but disintered bodies; all the subjects brought  to him by Burke and Hare, and that were examined  by him, he could not even guess at the  cause of their death. On these grounds we are  bound to believe that no blame can be attached  to the Doctor, seeing he himself is  equally as ignorant as his Students. In respect  to the words said to have heen spoken by the  Doctor with regard to the protection, and that

On my return home,  I found that a Inan answering to Burke's description,  had called for me at the early part of  the evening. When I retired to bed, I took a  retrospective view of the conduct of Burke  and Hare,Iremarked their shyness in answering  the questions I formerly put to thein respecting  the body of the girl Paterson. The su1)jects  generally brought by them, seemed always  fresher than those from other quarters. The  circuinstance of 9u7nle being still arnissing, and  no accounts whatever concerning him, rushed  on my mind, the conduct of the ir2dividuals  that very night, while a corpse nras lying iin  one corner of the hovel, in the same place, the  parties seemed to have been carousing in  the height of jollity ; another circumstance of  greater moment, now passed 'itefore me, the  subjects generally brought by 'ii zrn to the  Lecture Eoom, were uniforlnly  :;scked in a  box or chest ; now, thought I, If' these men  actually disinterred the body said to be among  the straw, it is more than probable, that they  would hare packed it up before sending it to  their own house, and not at all likely that  they would have unpacked it again.

Were Paterson remarked, that if tohe version  of the Confession of Burke, as given in the  public prints is correct, he has in many instances  given the words of Dr K-- as his (Paterson's).  And to show your Lordship what confidence  can be placed in Burke's Confession,  I'aterson relates the following anecdote, as told  him by Mr A. BP- n, on whose veracity  he can depend, and who was in the employment  of Dr B-- long before Paterson was  engaged :   Tke first time  lr Al-n saw  Burke or IIare was about the end of 182'7,  when one of them called at the Rooms during  the day and inquired of him if the Doctor  would purchase a subject, on being answered  he would, they returned in the evening with  the body of a very tall man in a sack. One  carried the sack while the other assisted behiild.  One of the arms of the subject was  hanging outside, at that time they seemed  flnrred and in a great hurry.

By reviewing the foregoii?g statement, and  coupling it with circumstances that has since  transpired, I thin ; your Lordship will admit  that there is strong circi mstantial evidence  existing against the parties, who have all along  steered clear of this aTair. I will commence  my rei  arlaiss far back as February 1828 ; at  that time, Bwke and Haye had been supplying  Dr I - with subjects for at least t  oor  three months previous ; at that time, lllr  3I--r, an assistant, if' not always, frequently  went with them, and again returned in about  an hour and a half with a sul ject, Mr AI--r  ought to be examined on this point; he must  know where these sul jects came from,-who  were the illdividlrals he saw,-possibly can tell  whether the sufiects were male or female.

IIcre is a chain of  strong circii llstantiale vidence against Hare, so  muc   so, that an Englisli jury would not have  the least hesitntio  in returning a verdict  against him ; still it rnay be said, that tilere is  no proof as to these men being the perpetrators  of the murder.  Tour Lordsl iym ust be aware that the law  does not always require eye witnesses to the  fact, for it justly observes, that these acts are  generally done in so secret a manner, that nine  cases out of ten would go unpunished; but that  a chain of circua:stanticil evif ent.e, well supported,  taking into considerakion the previous  c tzrscter of the parties, will be sufficient to  condemn.

            <pagetext>and Hare were seen last in Paterson's company  ; there is also sufficient : roof, that Rurke  and Hare brought the body of Paterson to  Surgeons Square, fifteen hours after she was  seen by Burke's brother. One witness can  swear that it was her body he saw in the 1,ecture  Room ; cornbine this wit11 the circumstance  of her nlysteriorls disappearance, and,  as an honest man, ask yoax own conscience, if  there is not sufficient proof to put HAREup nn  his trial for the murder. I will call your  Lordship's attention to another circumstance.  HAREbr ought a subject to Surgeons Square  while Burke was ahsent in the country, and delivered  it t o.-  MI r I think it would  be proper to examine  11- PcI- - upon this  point, as it possil ly mig11t be the body of the  person that was milrilered in LZrogganYs l ouse,  and the evidence obtained ii-om Dr K-, llTr  M- , Broggan, and possibly others, might  be of service in the prnsecutioal. Another chaitl  of circumstantial evidence against HARE is  this, James Wilson, or DAFTJ AMIIw?,a s seen  by many, the day of that evccirtg the nlilrdcr  was committed ; he was last sc  n in the West  Port with Burke or Btere; the  light after the  murder he was carried to Surgeons Square by

Sorne little time after the  porter was gone the box was opened, (as a suhject  was advised,) but to t h t utter astonishment  of those present, instead of a dead body,  there came forth a very fine bacon ham, a large  cheese, a basket of eggs, and a huge clue of  FCodden grey worsted,-a present, no doubt,

            <pagetext>from a col ntryc ousin, and intended to have  reached a diRereat destination. A body in a  box without address had come by the same conveyance,  and had, no doubt, been changed by  mistake; but what the feelings of the party  were who rewived it, judge ye    I cim told that sometimes the resurrection  men procure bodies from the Royal Infirmary ;  the stratagenl they make use of is nearly this,  they hear by their spies that such a person has  died without friends, one goes immediately and  claims kindred with the deceased, a coffin is  procured, and they are ger erallyr emoved to  some house acljacent for interment. The body,  however, does not receive this last token of respect,  for with all possible speed a box is procured  into which the corpse is crammed and  mediately disposed of.  On one occasion, I remember to have witnessed  one of the most daring scenes I ever  belleld On turning the corller of Surgeons  Square, I ol served two men ;t the trot wit11  a coffin on their sl oulders, in o len day, they  instaotly pli:nged into a certain 1,elcture Ihoom,  the corpse of a female was rolled out on the  flour, aud the coffin broke in n hundred pieces ;  they received very little for this body, as some  person in the surgical department of the Itoyai

            <pagetext>Infirmary had, with an instrument, so mangled  the body, as to render it almost useless to any  Lecturer. I do not mean to say, that the  gentleman who has the sole charge of the surgical  department, and through whose hands all  the bodies ought to pass I efore their friends  can receive them, was in any manner connected  with the mangling of the body. But if it  was suspected, that the persons claiming the  deceased, intended it for dissection, why give  it up to them, and if not, why should the body  be mangled ; possibly this is a new regulation  of the FIospital, of which I have not yet  heard. I am confitfeat that no blame can be  attached to AIr ilIarst1a11, liis late conduct  in track: ;rail recovering a botfy out of RIr  PvI H---'s Lecture Room, places him above  thesear11 o f susi icion- So much for home,I will  now take a trip to Ireland, which is the grand  mart for sairjeets. There are several agents  who supply tile Etfinburgh 1,ccteirt-rs with subjects,  at about A7 each, expences included,  these come in l o t 3 of' ten or twelve, sornetilnes  atldressect to one indivjdual, arid when such is  the case, the other professors attend and cast  lots ; this is when a gerrernl cargo arrives, but  the more frequent is for each professor to  receive his o m barrel, box, or hamper.

            <pagetext>TO THE  RIGHT HON. ROBERT PEEL, M. P.  HIS MAJESTY'S PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE  HOME DEPARTMENT.  21st January, 1829.  Sir,   THE excitement of the public mind, occasioned  by the late discovery of an established system of homicide-  the intense and hitherto unfailing interest attached  to the horrible career of the murderer Burke-and the  connection traced between the crimes of that wretched  man and the exigencies of such of His Majesty's lieges  as follow the medical profession, must be my apologies  for addressing you at this time.     I presume not to approach you, Sir, in any other  character than that of an humble individual, who  deems the atrocities now undergoing inquiry, a disgrace  to his country, and the reproach of that legislature by  which his country is governed; while, at the same time,  he thinks it foul scorn that his profession should  ever have been necessitated to traffick in the bodies of  murdered men.  B

            <pagetext>6    I make my present advance to you, Sir, because, as  His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home  Department, to you is confided the police of Great  Britain; and on you the responsible duty devolves of  providing preventitives against the commission of crime,  not less than of enforcing punishment when crime has  been perpetrated. The propriety, therefore, of making  my appeal to you, cannot, I imagine, be disputed, if  your official situation alone be regarded. I conceive it  admits of as little doubt on the part of any one who  with me has delighted to mark your progress as a  statesman, or, by the hearing of the ear, has become  acquainted with your character as a philosopher and  a philanthropist.     I shall not trespass upon your time, nor waste my  own words so far as to make a display of sentimentality,  or well-feigned virtuous indignation, when adverting to  the Being who, ere this letter shall have gone through  the press, will be ushered by the death's-man into the  presence of his God. I prefer sitting down to follow  his deeds of darkness to their source, and studying to  contrive how a repetition of such iniquities may be most  effectually prevented.  In pursuance of these two objects, it may not be  amiss to state the following, which are facts not admitting  of doubt, far less of denial. The criminal, Burke,  has committed several murders. He entered upon the  sanguinary office of an assassin because it promised to  be, at the outset, what he afterwards found it in reality  was, a most lucrative one; for, for the bodies of his slain  there was always a market at hand, and customers that  asked no questions, in the dissecting-rooms of anatomists.  The improvement of anatomical science, by dissection  of the human corpse, is indirectly contrary to the law  of this land; while the exhumation of cadavera for the  use of medical students, is in direct defiance of a legal

            <pagetext>7      statute, and not infrequently made a pretext for visiting  upon those that resort to the practice, the penalty of  other and graver offences. The robbery of church-yards,  notwithstanding its illegality, is a distinct art, followed  as a trade by a separate body of men, and affording  subsistence to a great number of people. To all the  medical profession, anatomical knowledge is of great  value-to surgeons, it is indispensably necessary. The  knowledge of anatomy required by both physicians and  surgeons, may be best attained in the dissecting-room ;  that which is essential to the surgeon, can be obtained  in no other way. Medical practitioners are liable to  civil actions, if injurious effects result from their malpractice  or neglect; nor is a plea of unavoidable ignorance  admitted in law, as either justifying or extenuating  the errors of practice, or the evils of negligence, although,  as has been already stated, legal impediments  oppose the acquisition of that knowledge by which  alone can ignorance be avoided, and the ills arising  from it prevented.     For the greater convenience of discussion, I shall  reduce the facts now stated to a few propositions, each  of which it is my design to consider in succession.       I.-The present state of the laws affecting that part  of medical education which depends on anatomy, makes  it impossible to study that science efficiently, without  incurring some degree of criminality.     II.-It is impossible for a surgeon, or surgeon-apothecary,  to practise his profession independent of an  intimate acquaintance with the structure of the human  frame, and at the same time consistently with the safety  of the public, his own comfort, and the security of his  property.     III.-When the legislature requires one thing, and  necessity demands another, not only must the enactment

IV.-All laws, whether private or public, the tendency  of which is to increase crime, by increasing the  temptations thereunto, are unjust, cruel, iniquitous, and  non-obligatory.     V.-When an actual increase in the crimes of a  country may be proved to be a consequence of any of  its laws, the guilt incurred belongs as much to that law,  or those laws, as to the perpetrators of all the crimes  originating therefrom.     VI.-The existing legal impediments to the study of  anatomy, by dissection of the human frame, are not  only opposed to the necessities of the medical profession,  but have been the remote causes of increased, and are  so still, of increasing crime.     VII.-The murders committed by Burke and his  associates having had a legal origin, the law which  divides the guilt with him, ought to share his reproach.       I have to observe, then, in the first place, that a  The  present state of the laws affecting that part of medical  education which depends on anatomy, renders it impossible  to study the science thereof efficiently, without  incurring some degree of criminality.      Not only has a medical student to acquire a sufficient  knowledge of that frame, whereon at some future time  he may be called to operate, or for the diseases of which  he will be expected to prescribe : he has to attain unto  such knowledge by close application in the dissectingroom,  where, seated among putrifying corpses, inhaling  the stench of dead bodies, and exposed to the danger  of losing health and life, (if he be, as I suppose, an  individual who has entered on the study of his profession  with a due sense of the responsibility it imposes on all

While be toils thus anxiously, and in the  midst of disagreeables unparalleled in any other course  of study; while he perils his health by exposure to the  pestilential atmosphere of a dead-house, and endangers  his life by braving the accidents too common to anatomists,  and which the experience of ages affirms to have  been too frequently fatal ; he finds himself opposed to  the legislature of that country which, on his mother's  breast, he learned to love and venerate, because his own,  and worthy of honour. This is his situation-he must  have human bodies to dissect. But he knows that  it is illegal to disinter a corpse, and that he would  be liable to be committed to jail for the offence.  Not only is there a statute to that effect in existence,  but very often has it been enforced, and very vindictively  too. Yet in that way, and in that way  only, though it be illegal, can our student obtain  the means of prosecuting his anatomical studies. An  example of the difficulty which may be supposed to  beset him, as well as of the illegality attached to  his studies, may speak more than a volume in this  place.  A gentleman of considerable professional attainments,  talent, and zeal, practising as a surgeon in Exeter, proposed  delivering a course of anatomical lectures and  demonstrations in that city. Upon one occasion, he

            <pagetext>10    employed some men to procure a recently interred  corpse, that he might be enabled to give his next lecture :  they being inexperienced resurrectionists, left the grave  deranged by their work; discovery ensued-the body  was found on Mr. Cooke's premises-himself taken into  custody and committed to prison on a magistrate's  warrant; and, as if farther to illustrate the malice of  ignorance, a portion of the deceased's grave-clothes  being found with the body, (a shroud and a cap, I  believe, articles of no use to a single living being, and  intended to rot and decay by those who buried them  )  the sapient administrator of law and equity placed his  victim on the list of felons, and refused to take bail for  his future appearance in a court of justice. An imprisonment  among thieves was the immediate consequence.  Being called shortly after to stand his trial  before an enlightened judge, and that bulwark of our  liberties, an independent jury, he was instantly freed  from the fouler charge, and put on his defence for the  lesser crime. According to law, he must necessarily be  found guilty; and his mitigated sentence was, that he  should pay a fine of one hundred pounds to our Lord the  King. His previous confinement, his own and a pregnant  wife's sufferings, in consequence of the prosecution  instituted against him, and a family of young children well  nigh ruined, being mercfully taken into consideration, he  was permitted to escape farther imprisonment. I might  adduce a dozen instances of like severity, if challenged  to their production; but, to establish the proposition  with which I set out, one authenticated case is as good  as a thousand.*    * The persecution endured by Mr. Cooke, his trial, and his sufferings,  found able recorders, and are given at length in the Medico-Chirurgical  Journal conducted by James Johnson, M. D., and in the Lancet, which

            <pagetext>11       It will be my endeavour, in the second place, to establish  the fact, that  It is impossible for a surgeon, or  surgeon-apothecary, to practise his profession, independent  of an intimate acquaintance with the structure of  the human frame, and at the same time consistently  with the safety of the public, his own comfort, and the  security of his property.      Several years of my own life were spent in the dissecting-  room ; they were spent there in brighter hours,  while hope was young, and while ambition conspired to  make me industrious. The lesson I there received  nine years ago, from my lamented master, the late  James Wilson, who died a professor of anatomy and  surgery to the Royal College of Surgeons in London,  was to consider anatomy as the basis of sound pathology,  and morbid anatomy as the best foundation of  judicious practice. That lesson was over and over again  repeated to me by Mr. Wilson's sometime partner, and  afterwards successor, in the Wind-mill-Street School,  the eloquent and talented Charles Bell, Esq. my master  in surgery, who is now one of the professors at the   London University.  And a hundred times was their  valuable lesson enforced on my attention in the theatre,  over the dead body, and during our familiar conversations,  by my deceased friend and teacher, the late John  Shaw, Esq. well known as a young and promising  surgeon, by his excellent work on the Diseases of the  Spine. What they taught me then, my personal observations  and experience have since abundantly confirmed;  and I have been the unwilling spectator of  blunders, gross as they were cruel, in the practice of  surgeons unhappily ignorant of anatomy, and occasion-      latter publication, if my memory betray me not, was foremost in stimulating  the profession to a subscription on Mr. C.'s behalf.

            <pagetext>12    ally ignorant of their own ignorance. I have witnessed  humane and skillful men deprived of their rest by day,  and of their sleep by night, before and after the performance  of serious operations, because they felt how  deficient was their anatomical acquirements, and knew  not the extent of the difficulties besetting them. And  I have read, with indignant interest, of civil actions  successfully instituted, for pecuniary damages, against  surgeons and general practitioners, on account of some  evil produced, or alleged to have been produced, through  their insufficient acquaintance with anatomy, or with  some branch of professional knowledge appertaining  thereunto. How, indeed, could it be otherwise?  When I first commenced dissecting, I paid at the rate  of four guineas for each subject in its unprepared state;  when last I tookk th  scalpel in my hand, it was to  operate on a body which, unprepared, cost ten guineas.  The space of time between the two periods was hardly  seven years. And now; with a consciousness that I  laboured, not only long, but assiduously, and even to  the ruin of my constitution ; and with the recollection  that I very often spent twelve hours a-day in actual  dissection, and eight more at study in my closet, I dare  not call myself more than a tolerable anatomist. Yet,  two-thirds of all the medical officers in the navy and  army, especially in the former service, and a like proportion  of all the English and Scotch resident general  practitioners, never spent more than a winter and a  half or two winters in the study of anatomy. Many of  these could not have afforded to purchase an adequate  number of subjects, at so extravagant a price as ten  guineas; while many more would find it impracticable,  for months together, to get a body at any cost whatever.  I have known even the teachers of anatomy themselves,  with classes of from 50 to 500 pupils, frequently compelled  to deviate from the original plan of their course,

            <pagetext>13    because unable to give successive demonstrations of the  several parts in their occurrent order; and, hence, I am  bold to affirm, it arises, that the anatomical classes are  worst taught of any.  From such a monstrous state of things as that displayed  above, what is to be expected?-that surgeons  will spring up, who, though uneducated, shall, as if by  intuition, be alike able, intelligent, and active ?-that  the public may depend upon having always at hand the  necessary quantity of competent medical men ?-or, that  the once honoured and still honourable profession of  medicine, can long continue to be regarded with complacency  and respect by that public? Such ideas are  absurd, ridiculous, and chimerical. In exact proportion  as the professors of any art or science deteriorate in  skill, or decline in learning, will the profession of which  they may be members sink in the popular esteem.  To illustrate my present proposition, let me mention  a striking fact. Perhaps in no part of the world does  any body of men rank higher for classical attainments,  philosophical knowledge, and general information, than  the Fellows of the London College of Physicians; they  all, with but one or two exceptions, are graduates of  the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge; yet these  gentlemen almost invariably study anatomy elsewhereand  why ? Books they might have to their hearts' content;  plates, too, are at their command in those seats of  wisdom, with plenty of learned leisure for the study.  The reason is plain ; the study is too important to them  to be lightly gone through ; the facts it contains too essential  for them to forego ascertaining the existence  thereof by personal observation where only they can be  met with-in the human frame itself. This they cannot  do in their colleges, for there the tables of the anatomical  professor are never burthened with the weight of a  dead body; and, consequently, they adjourn to the  C

            <pagetext>14    metropolis, or, better still, cross over to Dublin, or, if  they wish still greater facilities, join the multitude of  Englishmen in Paris.     I said I had been witness to gross professional blunders,  and of course concomitant injuries to the public --- to  intense, though needless anxiety on the parts of  medical men-and to private loss sustained by them  in their characters and their fortunes ; and I said, too,  that the whole arose from ignorance of anatomy. By  adducing an instance of each of these three evils, I  hope to make the importance of that science manifest.  Into a public hospital, a case of popliteal aneurism  was admitted. The patient a fit person, and willing to  undergo the usual simple and easy operation invented  by John Hunter. Unfortunately, the surgeon to whose  department he belonged upon his admission, went away  for a season a day or two after his reception, and a second  surgeon succeeded to the charge. Instead of this last  individual operating promptly and speedily, by his  direction a refrigerant lotion was kept applied to the  daily-increasing tumour, and plenteous libations of dissolved  Epsom salts were forced down the poor fellow's  throat. In vain did my colleague and I press upon our  superior's notice the urgency of the case, the danger of  delay, and the necessity of an immediate operation: a  mock consultation was indeed held, and-the same  treatment persisted in. Somewhat younger then than  I now am, I prepared a statement of the case, and  meant to have made a dangerous effort on the victim's  behalf, when the anxiety I had suffered, working upon  a feeble constitution, threw me on a bed of sickness,  feverish and delirious. While I was a convalescent,  the other surgeon returned to his duties, and after the  first visit to his wards, called another consultation on  this case, at which it was decided that no hope remained  of saving the limb, and that, to save the suf

            <pagetext>15      ferer's life, the leg must be removed the following day.  This took place in less, I think, than fourteen days  after the former consultation, which decreed to   temporise  a little longer.  Amputation took place; the  aneurism was examined, and thereon were found two  distinct sloughs, about to separate. The unavoidable  conclusion in consequence was, that, had not the knife  been so opportunely used, those sloughs within fortyeight  hours more must have been thrown - off, hemorrhage  would have followed, and, if instant assistance  should not have been procurable, death must have  closed the tragedy. I thank God   the man lived and  quitted the institution in good health; but he quitted  it without a leg; whereas, if, when he was received into  it, an incision of three inches in length had been made  in his thigh, and the femoral artery tied, the chances  are that the tumour would have been absorbed, and he  might have wallied out with both his legs. But the fact  was this, the surgeon knew not how to perform the  operation, nor where to seek for the artery.     A man with a diseased bladder, for which, during  eleven years, he had been diversely treated by various  practitioners, was brought into a public hospital to  undergo the operation of lithotomy, a stone having  been sounded a few days prior to this. His was a very  unfavourable, a most unpromising case, yet the agonised  creature was desirous to be  cut.  I remember well,  indeed I never shall forget, the intense anxiety of his  surgeon. Every work he could procure on the topic  he studied with diligence, every circumstance in the  case before him he examined with care, and proceeded  at length, with slow steps and sad forebodings, to perform  an operation, (I know not whether it was his first  of the kind,) sometimes, although seldom, tedious, often  difficult, and always dangerous. Surrounded by spectators,  few of whom were mere students, and hardly

            <pagetext>16      one but set himself up for a critic,--some with their  stop-watches in hand, and others engaged in idle conversation,  alike disgraceful to themselves and annoying  to the operator,-he commenced his undertaking, and  succeeded admirably in every stage, until, on introducing  the forceps, he could not grasp the calculus: it  was attached to a fungous growth from the front part of  the bladder, and situated near to the pubis. Instead of  a stone, sand only was brought away, and a large irregular  branch of the perineal artery spouted forth large  quantities of blood. He became confused; his coolness  -nay, I may say his courage-left him; he forgot all  his book-learning, and exhausted himself and his  patient in unavailing, because ill-directed, attempts to  overcome a difficulty he had not foreseen, and did not  quite comprehend, until, after fifty minutes, the poor  man was again put to bed, apparently worse off than  when he left it. Two or three days after, the stone was  ejected through the wound. And the man survived for  some months, ultimately dying from an accumulation of  diseases, intimately connected with the urinary organs,  yet totally distinct from the incision made into his  bladder; and until death closed his sufferings, I am  fully persuaded sleep never brought refreshment to his  chirurgical attendant.     The third case I shall produce, is one where the  presumed ignorance of the practitioner lost for him his  character and his money. It did not fall under my  observation, but has long been before the public in a  printed form. An accident took place in a crowded  city, whereby a man had his shoulder dislocated. He  applied at the nearest  doctor's  to get it reduced.  The principal being from home, his assistant, in his  absence, set, as he imagined, the disjointed bone. Some  hours after, the person thus injured was seen by the  former, who, judging from the usual appearances that

            <pagetext>17    all was well, deemed it unnecessary to distulb the  bandage which had been applied, and gave his opinion  accordingly. In the course of a few days it was seen  that dislocation existed-whether the primary dislocation  unreduced, or   consecutive,  it was impossible  to distinguish. This much was certain, - reduction no  longer appeared practicable, and permanent lameness  and deformity were the results. The surgeon was  tried, and a verdict returned against him, awarding one  hundred pounds damages to the plaintiff in the action.  Now, if that verdict were (which indeed I much doubt)  a just one, nothing but ignorance, terrible ignorance,  will account for the error. Yet that ignorance could  only have been prevented by a study which the law  indirectly forbids.     What is the inevitable conclusion to be drawn from  all these cases, but that it is impossible for a chirurgical  practitioner to follow his profession successfully as  regards the public, and comfortably and creditably as  concerns himself, unless his professional education has  been founded on the broad, solid, and substantial basis  of anatomy, and anatomy acquired not by poring over  books, written for pelf or a name, got up in discreditable  haste, teeming with inaccuracies, dry in description  as an auctioneer's catalogue, and tedious in detail as  any merchant's ledger when interspersed with cabalistic  signs which the inventor himself can ill contrive to  read; and often as unintelligible as bad grammar, sheer  nonsense, and most melancholy  philosophy (?) can  render them, to say nothing of harsh compounds of  Greek and Latin words, no doubt intended for the  enlightenment of youths who know little of the language  of Cicero and ancient Rome, and less of that spoken  by Demosthenes in ancient Athens :-not by the most  careful examination of drawings, engravings, and the  like, where the skill of the artist and the elegance of

I must here beg leave to vary my position somewhat,  for I am most anxious at this part to make my argument  clear to the dullest apprehension, and evident to  the most dim-visioned understanding, When I was an  hospital-dresser in London, a boy-had both his arms  injured and dreadfully mutilated by an explosion of  gunpowder: the hand and part of the fore-arm on one  side were suspended by a mere thread of skin ; from the  other side all the limb was removed, except a ragged  looking stump. At the same instant of time, two severe  accidents of a different chacacter mere also brought  into the ward. That excellent and very superior surgeon,  R. Cartwright, Esq., whose reception-week it was,  had to attend to the whole himseli; and went through  his work with that cool deliberation, calmness of manner,  and soberness of deportment, which proceeded out  of confidence in himself-a confidence arising from the  clear perception of what he really had to do;-and  what was that? To perform, at an unseasonable hour  of the night, no less than four widely different operations,  each requiring anatomical knowledge, and each  requiring the immediate application of that knowledge.  To refer but to one case, how would a book-taught  anatomist have known where to lay hold of the arteries?  The jets of blood talked about in books, would have  furnished him no guide, for the stump's entire surface  effused blood; and even the assistance of engravings  would not have helped him, for, before my friend Mr.

            <pagetext>19      Alcock commenced his beautiful series of plates illustrative  of sectional anatomy, there was not in existence  aught of the kind. I am aware that, in the hurry of  battle, a military surgeon may have to operate as suddenly,  and with as little time for preparation, upon five  times the number of persons, but unless he be an  anatomist he cannot do so as he ought. And, be it  ever borne in mind, that it is not the multitude of operations,  nor the kind, no, nor always the success which  attends them, nor the whole united, which prove the  operator to be a good one, for all these circumstances,  not excepting the last mentioned, may be completely fortuitous.  But it is the manner in which he performed  those operations: that, and that only, is solely dependent  on himself; and by that I would judge him, if at  all: for I know that a bad anatomist, or even a bad  dissector, was never yet a skilful operator.  I remark, thirdly, that '' When the legislature requires  one thing, and necessity demailds another, not  only must the enactment of the former be disregarded,  but, in process of time, temptations will accumulate to  supply the wants of the latter, by unlawful as well as  by illegal means.   I have already endeavoured to prove that legal  restrictions, in this country, interfere with the facilities  of obtaining the requisite anatomical instruction;  and that not only is there no legal provision for a  supply of subjects to the schools, at all adequate to  the demand ; but the removal of cadavers from churchyards,  is an offence which the law visits with fine and  imprisonment.  I have also attempted to establish the fact, that, for  a medical man to discharge his duty to the public, his  family, or himself, it is indispensably necessary that he  should be a thorough anatomist, which, moreover, he

            <pagetext>20    cannot become until he shall have worked in the dissecting-  room.     Before discussing my present proposition, I shall  explain the different meanings I intend to convey  when using the terms legal and lawful, in distinct  senses. By the word legal, I understand-according  to the will of any legitimate earthly government;  whereas, by the word lawful, I would signify-according  to the declared will of God. Cases have  occurred to render perfectly justifiable the utmost  resistance to the former. No case can ever arise to  warrant the slightest disobedience to the latter. - It is  undeniable, that, in almost every state and country,  there have existed unjust, partial, and oppressive  institutions. One age witnessed the auto da fe kindled  in divers places to burn up heresy and heretics, till it  might leave them neither root nor branch :-another  beheld the lion's mouth yawning at the corners of  public streets, eager to swallow secret information, no  matter how false or how wicked, against all sorts of  persons, without respect to rank, office, or character :-  a third looked on with horror, where the guillotine  slew its thousands, and every lamp-post served for a  gallows:-while a fourth stands by and counts the  millions of money distilled from the sweat of the  labourer's brow to enrich the droning sinecurist's  purse. The right of any citizen, who may be exposed  to either of these oppressions, to   take arms against  the sea of troubles, and, by opposing, end them,   although his individual resistance stop not short of  blood, is indisputable. What right would justify,  however, expedience does not always sanction. And  where wrong is sustained by a mere individual member  of society, if such wrong have no tendency to establish  a precedent dangerous to others, I hold passive obedience  to be the Christian's duty. But even self-pre

            <pagetext>21    servation, the instinct leading to which is the most  lawless, and, in every case, the strongest, does not,  cannot justify, however it may extenuate, coveteousness,  theft, murder. The reason is plain. Man made the  law which may be violated, a likeness of himself-imperfect.  The immutable Jehovah pronounced the  command which none may change, a dim and shadowy  image of his own bright and glorious perfection.  The right of a citizen to resist any known law of the  government under which he lives, must ever be one,  the exercise of which extreme circumstances can alone  fully justify; and although imperative necessity may  make resistance to a legal enactment perfectly defensible,  that resistance can never be entered upon, save  at considerable moral hazard. When crime begins,  no human foresight can perceive where it shall cease.  Sedition and rebellion may only be the monstrous  growth of early filial disobedience. Like falling bodies,  the progress of crime to its profoundest depths is increasingly  rapid. Lucifer fell a star from heaven,  lighted as a toad on earth, and is now a devil - in hell.  And the occurrence is rare, of one, who, after being  accustomed to look human law in the face without an  emotion of reverence, remains slow to treat divine  decrees with contumely and scorn.  Now, the facts, as they concern the case of the  medical student, are these;-to acquire anatomy practically,  he must have bodies to dissect. Providentially,  the number of murderers has never been enough to  furnish the lecturer's table, far less to satisfy his pupils'  wants. No other class of executed criminals is by law  disposed of to the surgeons, rlor is there any other  legislative provision of the kind. On the contrary, if  a grave be opened for the sake of the rotting body it  contains, it must be in defiance of popular feeling,  and in violation of legal enactments. Are not the

            <pagetext>22        necessities of the public and the requirements of the  statute directly in conflict here? And what, let me  ask, can the student do in such a situation? He must  either abandon his profession or offend the law. He  must either turn his thoughts, his talents, and his  hopes towards another calling, for which he is unfitted,  alike by his inclination and his previous education ; or  he must condescend to contribute to the support of - -  gangs of law-breakers, wretches so depraved as not to  shudder at the occupation of catering for the anatomist's  studies : and withal so vile as to volunteer for the service,  though an illegal as well as a disgusting one, on condition  of being paid for their trouble. Can there be any  doubt, notwithstanding all the difficulties surrounding  his election, as to which line of conduct he will choose?  My own opinion has been long decided, that no law  is binding, by whomsoever decreed, which is not at the  same time just. And were I commanded by any earthly  superior, no matter how exalted his rank or legitimate  his right to rule me, to do aught which I knew to be  contrary to the laws of my Maker, the essence of all  common law, I would refuse obedience, promptly and  peremptorily, on the acknowledged principle that no  inferior has power of himself to set aside the will of  a superior: consequently, no mere creature can be  licensed to issue a decree opposed to those of his Creator.  Thus thinking, were I to resume my anatomical  studies to-morrow, I would unhesitatingly disinter, and  concur in disinterring the buried dead, though every  act of Parliament were to denounce me in a separate  damnatory clause. I would dare, in such a matter, to  disobey all human governors, rather than provoke the  one Eternal Governor of the Universe, by neglecting  any means of increasing my usefulness to mankind. I  canvass not the cruel tyranny of those laws, by which  I am interdicted from the most profitable mode of study

            <pagetext>23    ing how to avoid error, yet made punishable with fine,  imprisonment, and, worse than either, ignominy, if by  my error I do a neighbour wrong. As well might a  man be hanged for falling on another and causing his  death, although himself thrown down by a power he  could not resist. But, I protest most solemnly against  any law, whether senatorial or not, which, if submitted  to, threatens to expose me at some future time to all  the stings and pangs of a guilty conscience. I care  not for fortune:-if my country need all mine, to it she  shall be thrice welcome. I prize not even health so  highly, but that, to benefit my fellow-creatures, I could  cheerfully sacrifice it. I cling not to life itself with so  great love, as for a moment to hesitate about resigning  it, if thereby I might ensure a single benefit to the  human race. Life, health, fortune, I consider lent me  by my Heavenly Benefactor for the use of mankind;  but that which is mine exclusively, to which none but  myself has the least title, the repudiation of which  could do no man any service, my peace of mind, I dare  not with suicidal hand put from me. I cannot, I will  not esteem it my duty to lay myself open, for country,  kind, nor universe, to the reproaches of conscience,  awakened by the dreadful crime of practising an awfully  responsible profession in a state of wilful ignorance.  Neither prince, nor potentate, nor power, has the  smallest right to force me into any situation of which  the above may be the consequences: and no law of  which such is the tendency, has any just claim to my  fealty. If, through ignorance of some part of the  human frame, I commit a serious, though it may not  be a fatal mistake in operating, poor satisfaction is it to  the injured person, should the law, to satisfy the cravings  of his vengeance, make me a bankrupt in estate ;-  poorer satisfaction still is it to me, to give my gold a compensation  for the ill I wrought, while unsleeping memory

            <pagetext>24      torments me with the reflection that I have maimed a  fellow-creature, perhaps rendered him helpless for life ;  when, had I taken care to be better informed in my  profession, I had nver done him that irreparable wrong.  Whilst, therefore, I connive at the illegal practices of  the resurrectionists, I do it, compelled thereto by dire  necessity ; I do it, to avoid the risk of losing the calm  and quiet of my mind here, and to prevent the eternal  torture of my soul hereafter.     Were the evil to terminate in the commission of an  illegal act, it would be a great one ; but there it seldom  terminates. The offence is attended with too much  peril, the result of detection is too humiliating to admit  of medical students generally becoming  resurrectionists   in their own behalf, and they are driven to look  for needy men who will serve their stead; or, in plainer  terms, to offer premiums for the commission of crime.  These, their tools, are occasionally arrested by the civil  power ; the phrenzy of mobs pointed towards them ; and  a prison thrown open to receive them. The risks to  which, from time to time, they are exposed, serve them  for pleas to extort higher wsges. The premium for  crime thus increases, and the temptations to commit it  of course increase in proportion. Yet even here the  evil does not end. In addition to the risk he runs of  caption by the police, a more dreadful peril scowls upon  the path of the resurrectionist in the vigilant surveillance  of those who watch the new-made graves g- raves of departed  relatives; sanguinary contests thence take place,  terminating but by the effusion of blood-sometimes  put a stop to only by murder; until, led on from one  crime to another, he becomes so familiar with iniquity  that its most horrible shape ceases to look horrible. But,  as if history was resolved to finish the narrative with a  more crowning horror than any of the preceding, the  fact is now notorious, that to cheat the body-stealer of

Blot all such legislative iniquities out of the  statute book, and cause the blank they leave to be filled  up with enactments providing for the public security ;  whereby the idle, the needy, and the dissolute may be  no more tempted to steal and kill that they imay have  wherewithal to overcharge themselves with surfeiting  and drunkenness.       I anticipate no objection to my fourth proposition, that   All laws, whether private or public, the tendency of  which is to increase crime, by increasing the temptations  thereunto, are unjust, cruel, iniquitous, and nonobligatory.   Such are they to which repeated allusion has been  made in the foregoing pages. What can be more un-

What can be more  cruel, than to take away from him whose office it is to  recover the sick, heal the wounded, and soothe the  dying, the means afforded him for doing so efficiently  and extensively? What can be more iniquitous, than  to prefer, by the solemn voice of the legislature, the  dead to the living, by making it a misdemeanour to  take a body from the grave; where, perchance, it had  not been so soon deposited, if, when the residence of a  living soul, it had been properly taken care of? And  what can be less entitled to our respect and obedience,  than measures, the history of the consequences of which  is one unbroken tale of gradually progressive and  constantly darkening crime, ending, if indeed the end  be yet, in one deed more dreadful than the rest, and  unworthy of being recorded, save with a pen dipped in  human gore?     Nor can such discussion be required to establish my  fifth proposition, that When an actual increase in the  crimes of a country may be proved to be a consequence  of any of its laws, the guilt incurred belongs as much  to that law, or those laws, as to the perpetrators of all  the crimes originating therefrom.      This is a fearful consideration, and well calculated to  make the law-giver pause ere he set his seal to any  enactment whatsoever. It is far easier to do an injury  than to repair one. The government which, despite of  the warning voice of prophecy, speaking in thunder by  William Pitt the first, obstinately refused to withdraw  its legal fetters from the then British occupants of North  America, (though these latter cried not aloud until the

And would that the men were alive who  framed the iniquitous measures of which I complain,  that they might hear me denounce them as the authors  of a Burke's enormities   But I war not with the dead;  my quarrel now is with the living-with those who have  ears to hear and tongues to make reply. Let the obnoxious  act be swept away like some noisome pestilence,  which in good truth it really is; or who is there but  must, if he possess a sane mind, and desire to preserve  a healthy conscience, charge the guilt of future assassinations  by body-sellers to those on whom the blood  of every human being slain in the Irish tiger's den  calls from the ground for vengeance. On you, Sir,  on His Majesty's other Ministers, on the whole Parliament  of Great Britain, Great Britain herself cries aloud  for vengeance for the past, for protection for the future.  And who will dare to manifest indifference to such a  demand-at such a time-on such an occasion ? He is  not the only dealer in that horrible commodity, the  corpses of murdered men, against whom is gone forth  the righteous sentence of death. There are others, be  sure, yet untracked, who have not missed so fair a  chance of earning five hundred pounds per annum. Or  think you, Sir, in all the brothels which alike teem in  and disgrace the metropolis of England-out of all the  pimps and bullies who fatten and grow stout in those  strong-holds of sin and death, are there no Hares, no  Burkes to be met with?

            <pagetext>28          a notorious one, that many resurrectionists add to their  trade as such, the still worse occupation of a lodginghouse  keeper for the accommodation of harlots.* In the  lanes, courts, and alleys, from the eastern extremity of  Blackwall to the western boundary of Pimlico, including  Ratcliffe Highway, Shadwell, the City Road, the filthy  purlieus of the several theatres, the back neighbourhoods  of the Strand, the crowded tenements in St. Giles's :-  In the cider-cellars, oyster-rooms, shades, coal-holes,  finishes, arid saloons, those foul haunts of whore and  drunkard   those dark and infamous seminaries of vice,  which never throw their doors a-jar before midnight   are there no such lucre-loving spirits as might be persuaded  to see, in the sum of ten guineas, an adequate  remuneration for one murder? In the sale-rooms of  London thieves, where Bow-Street officers are happy  to introduce any gentleman beguiled of his watch, who  has no objection to receive it again, on payment of  half its value:-In the gay and crowded assemblies,  night after night, of protean mendicants,-are there  really none to be found, on whom, were the suspicion          *   A fortnight ago we had the pain of calling the attention of our  readers to the most extraordinary and atrocious crimes tbat ever came  within our cognizance-the deliberate organized system of murder, for  the sake of selling the dead bodies for dissection. We have now the task  of recording the trial and conviction of two of the culprits. Nothing  can exceed in horror the details of this atrocity, except the extent to  which it was intended to carry the practice. Have similar murders  ever been committed in London? and if so, may they not be repeated ?  the facilities of perpetration and concealment being so much greater than  in Edinburgh. We knew of one case, where a young and sensitive girl,  seduced from her friends in the country, was deserted by her betrayer, a  man of fashion, and died in her lodgings it was said of a fit of apoplexy.  The landlord, a resurrection-man, who supplied one of the hospitals,  alarmed at the disrepute of his trade and the infamy of his house, concealed  the body under the stairs till it was putrescent, and then sold it at  the theatre of an hospital. --The Englishman, Dec. 28th, 1828.

            <pagetext>29        to alight of their being similarly engaged to the Edinburglr  gang, it would not press unjustly? Nay, farther,  are all the inferior performers at our offices of police  incapable, totally incapable, of doing what Burke has  done ? Ireland can never forget   England must always  remember   that diabolical blood-money affair which  took place some years ago.       I have to show, sixthly, that   The existing legal  impediments to the study of anatomy by dissection of  the human frame, are not only opposed to the necessities  of the medical profession, hut have been the remote  causes of increased, and are so still of increasing crime.      I may be told that the law but registered what the  public felt; and I am ready to admit that few things  are more unpopular in this country than the disinterment  of the dead. Nor would I combat as a prejudice  what I approve of as a national feeling. More: I acknowledge  there is a sanctity surrounding the tomb,  which ought not to be profaned;--a sacred character  attached to every burying-place, which it is wrong to  lessen;-a secrecy belonging to the vale of graves, the  violation of which can only be justified by the most  argent necessity : but that sanctity, that sacredness,  that secrecy, are best protected by the vigilance of those  who have buried their dead. The imposition of fine  and imprisoninent upon church-yard robbers, never  did, and never will deter from church-yard robbery.  Soon as one of the gang is pounced upon by the constabulary,  another steps forward to supply his place:  and the greater the peril, the higher the reward-the  higher the reward, the more numerous they that seek it.  These circumstances, springing, as they do, from the  laws affecting anatomical instruction, have called into  existence a set of men whose trade consists in the  evasion of those laws. I would not venture to assert

            <pagetext>  30      that the persons alluded to are made villains solely  thereby, for I very well know that they were all such,  or thoroughly ripe to become such, before they would  enter upon the loathsome and disreputable business of  the resurrectionist. I only affirm, that the laws  referred to open another way of support to the idle and  dissolute, and strew additional temptations in their  path to make them vicious and criminal. It will be  conceded me, that even highway robbers are not at all  times equally prone to add violence to plunder; nor  does it admit of a doubt that they have occasionally  done so without premeditating it, disposed thereto by  unexpected resistance on the part of those they sought  to steal from, and when their only alternative has been  to resign themselves prisoners with the certainty of  being hanged. Few travellers, when assaulted by a  necessitous footpad, exercise the presence of mind and  cool courage of the Rev. Rowland Hill, or a greater  number of thieves might be saved from perdition, as  was the starving wretch by whom he was attacked. Of  course I am not attempting to palliate that disgraceful  species of crime which renders it unsafe for a wayfaring  and defenceless man to ride alone by night, in many  districts; but I would inquire whether the atrocities  charged upon the resurrectionist might not have been  in a great degree prevented, if, when idle and inclined  to dissipation, there had been no such roads to easy  and luxurious living, as those opened by the laws for  the security of the buried dead? Sure I am, if there  had been fewer obstacles to anatomical instruction,  there never would have been so high a price offered  by the teachers and students of anatomy for cadavera,  as to be a temptation in the way of the most indigent to  commit murder.  Various are the means resorted to for procuring  subjects. To almost every hospital in London, there is

            <pagetext>31    one surgeon attached, who combines the business of  tuition and the practice of surgery. Where, as generally  happens, provision is made in the regulations of  the charity for the burial of its unclaimed dead, an  undertaker contracts for their interment at so much  a-piece. But observe, Sir, what foliows : the surgeonlecturer  wants a corpse, he confers with the undertaker,  the coffin is filled with clay, and the body it was destined  to contain is surreptitiously conveyed to the dissecting-  room.  Another mode, which I know to be a common one  likewise, is this: A resurrectionist is informed that a  poor person died in such a street, and is not to be interred  until such a day. Accompanied by some of his  fellows, he pays the house a visit, contrives to get the  friends out of the way, and, during their absence,  carries off the corpse, and disposes of it to the highest  bidder.  A third plan, is to contract with the relatives of a  being about to die, and they, when he is no more, give  up his body for dissection.  But, are not all these crimes? Do not the perpetrators  of each deserve condign punishment? And  the prevalence of all, does it not occasion misgivings  lest they should lead on to other and darker deeds?  If an undertaker, contracting to bury the unclaimed  dead of a charitable institution, breaks his contract,  and with one hand clenching the full payment for  interring stones and rubbish, as though a corpse was  there instead, closes the other upon a felonious bribe,  received from the hospital surgeon for handing into  the cell of the latter the body he ought to have consigned  decently to its grave ;-what security have you,  Sir, or I, or any man, h t when we request the  services of an undertaker to encoffin some clear departed  friend, that individual will resist the tempta

Or,  supposing the honest rogue incapable of such a theft,  what security have we that he will not cheat us into the  belief that our dead is buried out of our sight, when he  may only have effected its transportation to the dissectingroom?   If men habituate themselves to enter  houses where they are unknown, for the purpose of  gaining illicit possession of the lifeless remains of  humanity, how is the public to be assured that these  same men will entertain any scruples about returning  to the scene of their depredation to take equal liberties  with other kinds of property? And, if the revolting  practice of selling the bodies of deceased friends and  relatives, like carrion, be not for ever ended, how is  Great Britain to be certified of the improbability of a  second Hare, on his departure from the sale of the dead,  straightway engaging in the murder of the living?       This last interrogatory naturally introduces my  seventh proposition, that   The murders committed by  Burke and his associates having had a legal origin, the  law; which divides the guilt with him, ought to share  his reproach.      If the principle laid down in a former page be incontrovertible,  and if the facts already alleged be found  proven, it must be acknowledged that to her existing  laws this country owes the reproach brought  on her name by the crimes recently committed in the  capital of Scotland. Nor can the present generation  of legislators acquit themselves of all share in the consequences  of those laws. Public colleges, private  teachers, those whose educations were completed, and  those engaged in studying their professions, all, from  time to time, but more particularly of late, have petitioned  Parliament to take the matter into their most

Now, with this   strong   and  distinct  statement, before the legislature, of the  evils,  c. it may be asked,  And have they done  nothing?  No, nothing   A Committee of the House  of Commons, it is true, was appointed, and witnesses,  some competent, some incompetent, examined before it,  but no provision has hitherto been made to diminish  those evils, or to lessen the encouragements to crime  generated by them. Is the law, then, blameless? Are  the guardians thereof blameless ? Or, are the demoniac  Hare, his other self, Margaret Laird, and the abandoned  strumpet Helen M'Dougal, the only accessories  before as well as after the murders committed by him  who, while I write, has his days numbered by public  justice? Were I to say, I thought the affirmative, I  should belie my conscience-become the flatterer of the  great-and the justifier of the guilty. No, Sir, the law  is not blameless, for it has failed to guard against such  atrocities as Burkeys,-nay, indirectly it has afforded  encouragement to men like him. Nor are those whom  our revered Sovereign and his loving subjects have  elected to hold the reins of government, and to protect  their rights, their properties, and their persons, without  all spot or totally blameless, else why such indifference  to the wants of a profession, acknowledgedly learned,  respectable, and useful? whence such inattention to the  evils pointed out as inseparable from anatomical instruction  in this; country ? when, too, these evils could

Now is the season at which it is most needed;  and though it should be excluded for the present, the  time is not distant when it shall prevail over private  clamour, legislative injustice, and popular prejudice.     From the foregoing facts and observations, the following  inference is fairly deducible :-It behoves the  Parliament of Great Britain, and His most Sacred  Majesty's Ministers, to take into their attentive consideration,  the present state of anatomical instruction,  and the evils attendant thereon, in order to encourage  the one, to obviate the other, and the more effectually  to prevent the recurrence of such transactions as have  lately disgraced this country.     Before trespassing a single scheme upon your notice,  I crave permission to direct your attention to the actual  condition of the principal schools for the study of  medicine in this kingdom,  c. as far as the facilities  they afford for anatomical instruction are concerned.     EDINBURGH, even, when in the zenith of her fame as  a medical university, with Cullen and Gregory, John  Bell, and Alexander Monro in the number of her  teachers, never ranked high as a school of anatomy.  While, in our day, with a Barclay, a Thomson, and a  Lixars to instruct her students, the materials of study  have to be purchased at the hand of the murderer       GLASGOW, the university of William Hunter, and the  depository of his splendid museum, the city where  Allan Burns taught, and the honoured mother of many  scholars, has not an anatomical school of either note  or name.     LONDON, privileged by partial and exclusive laws to  be the only authorised place of surgical education in all  England, is forced, for the supply of her dissecting

            <pagetext>35      rooms, to support whole gangs of hardened and unprincipled  men, who, for money, will dare to breathe  defiance at the state, and brave its every penalty.     DUBLIN, by robbing the hospitals and the graves,  silently and in secret, has pre-eminence over any of  these, but is herself inferior to     PARIS, where so cheap are bodies, so unrestrained is  dissection, that a majority of the medical students of  Great Britain emigrate thither to prosecute their professional  studies, and, by way of counterbalancing the  advantages derived from French anatomy and pathology,  bring back with them French politics, which  are republican-French morals, which are licentious and  French Deligion, a term there can be no occasion  for me to explain or characterise.     Over all GERMANY, there is comparatively no difficulty  attendant on anatomical instruction. And even in     LISBON, the comparatively deserted capital of a fallen  country, where tyranny and superstition stride over  wreck and ruin, neither the clamour of its mobs, nor  the despotism of its magistracy affects any interference  in the matter of surgical education. A corpse may  always be had for the value of an English half-crown,  merely a porter's fee.       My humble endeavour must now be to indicate such  measures as, if adopted, might serve for the accomplishment  of every end desired-by which, while the  dead were suffered to repose in safety in their graves,  the medical profession might receive an ample supply  of subjects ; the rising generation of practitioners become  better qualified to engage in practice; the sick  members of the community be less exposed to the evils  of ignorance in their professional attendants; and the  poor and helpless who walk our streets, be more secure  from murder.

            <pagetext>36         There are three sources from whence all the dissecting-  rooms in the United Kingdom would be sufficiently  filled with bodies.     1. Suicides.     2. All persons, no matter what their crime, who  suffer the punishment of death.     3. All convicts dying in prison.       I shall first glance at two or three of the many various  plans submitted to the public, and then unfold my  reasons for proposing the above. The principal sources  recommended by others are, the unclaimed dead of  public hospitals; the deceased inmates of work-houses ;  and the lifeless and unknown alien and stranger. I  conceive that the most flagrant injustice and oppression  would be perpetrated if either of such unfortunates  were to be doomed by the law to dissection when they  expire.     An honest hard-working labourer, in the course of  his employment happens to fall from a scaffold, and so  fractures his leg or arm as to require immediate amputation,  he is received within the walls of an hospital,  and after a few days he dies. What crime, I wish to  know, has this man committed,-though there be no  living creature near to read in his face the lineaments of a  friend; though, except the labourer's rags which barely  serve to hide his nakedness, he be utterly destitute;-to  justify the consignment of his body to the dissector's knife?  If the practice were once allowed of sending all the unclaimed  corpses from the hospitals to the anatomical  theatres, although it might, and doubtless would in a  great degree prove effectual with respect to the latter,  it would have a most deplorable influence on the minds  of those confined to bed in the former; for, to the  agonies occasioned by disease and accident, would then  be added the worse torments of suspense and anxiety.

            <pagetext>37      Vain, then, the soothing language and kind offices of  the poor man's medical attendant; the sad fact would  never quit the patient's mind, that, in the event of his  dying, his body must be given over for dissection. The  horror of having after death to undergo the operations  of the anatomist, would wholly absorb his thoughts, to  the complete exclusion of all comfort, all consolation.  No, no  our charitable institutions must not be thus  invaded; at least let them be regarded with as much  respect as our cemeteries : the evils inseparable from the  best of such establishments are many and crying enough ;  let no unhallowed hand, by adding to the number thereof,  increase the reasons for that too general repugnance  entertained towards hospitals and infirmaries by the  honest and industrious, always the most independent  and deserving of the lower orders. Rather let the arm  of the law stretch forth to their support, than be extended  to destroy any one of their just claims on the  confidence of the sick and the afflicted. If their inmates  be strangers, let us look upon the fact as strengthening  the sufferer's title to our tenderest care ; if friendless,  as adding urgency to the appeal they make for the  utmost protection we can afford them; if poor, as  rendering our duty to assist them more imperative.  Above all, while we give liberally of our abundance to  satisfy their cravings, and to secure them bodily relief,  let us diligently shun the bare possibility of outraging  their feelings ; let us forget not they are men, our brethren,  and perhaps fellow-christians.     And, if we have no right so to appropriate the  body of a person who died unknown in a public hospital,  we have less right so to deal with that of the  individual who breathed his last in the parish workhouse.  It should be borne constantly in mind, that  the despised and too often censured inhabitant of  this latter place, is generally one who, at a former

            <pagetext>38      period of his life, contributed his share to the poor's  rate on which he is now dependent; or, one who,  when possessed of youth, health, and strength, worked  hard, and was no drone, nor would have entered  that abode of the wretched and forsaken, if not compelled  to it by hunger and thirst, or nakedness, or the  want of a place where to lay his head. Does any of  these circumstances, or do the whole, constitute a right  on the part of the legislature or the public to the dead  bodies of persons who in the last hour of their life were  exposed to all the miseries of poverty, aggravated by a  sense of dependence? They ought rather, methinks, to  throw a halo over the tenements occupied by our English  poor; to make them be regarded as sanctuaries, the  sanctuaries of the blind, the lame, the leprous, the deaf,  the dumb, the helpless, and the aged; where want may  cease to pine, woe forget to mourn, and despair give  way to hope. Oh   never, never let these abodes of  wretchedness be invaded, because they are such, by the  tidings that those whom Providence is pleased to try in  the fire of adversity, those whom quondam friends refuse  to recognize, or even those whom their own folly  and imprudence have dragged down from respectability  to pauperism, are, when they expire, to be as little  regarded as dead dogs, though science be thereby never  so much improved, and the public health thereby obtain  an additional guarantee. For all these, one time  or another, were taxed to support that fund, the intention  of whose founders was, that it should provide  for the poor-food when starving, clothing when naked,  medicine when sick, an asylum when houseless, the  rites and consolations of religion when dying, and a  burial when dead.     But what shall be said to the proposal of giving to the  anatomist's knife the corpse of the alien and the stranger,  who, far removed from friends, from home, from country,

To lend such a measure the  approving sanction of Parliament, would be to cast a  stain, which nothing might obliterate, upon the fair  scutcheon of old England, the wonted refuge of the  oppressed  -contact with whose soil emancipates the  slave   and whose circumambient atmosphere welcomes  the stranger ere he treads her shores   England   my  birth-place, my cradle, my home, my country, my  idol, (if idol I have any,) forbid it thou   that so inhospitable  a deed be perpetrated by thy sons, far less  countenanced by their laws, as to withhold Christian  interment from those whom religious persecution, political  oppression, or personal misfortunes may drive  from their own dear native lands, to seek in thee a refuge  from the storm, and a covert from the blast  I  have often wandered beneath the tall cypresses which  throw their mournful-looking, melancholy shades over  the tombs of my countrymen in the burial ground of  the English Factory at Lisbon, and have sickened and  grown sad at the pithy tale told in their affectingly  simple epitaphs,   who came to Lisbon for the benefit  of their healths, and--died    Then, if, when I turned  to go away, my eyes chanced to behold some wan and  woe-begone stranger, with a feeble step, an emaciate  frame, and hollow countenance flushed with the warm  hectic of consumption, I would, on the supposition of  his being an Englishman and about to die, marvel  greatly how he came to leave his own fireside, a fond  family, and loving friends; and grieve too that perchance  he might never set his eyes upon them more.  Yet such, Sir, is not only a picture of the British in-  valid in Portugal, but the likeness of many a noble  Spaniard, of many a brave Lusitanian, of many a  talented German in Britain : men too they are with the  same blood circulating through their frames, which bids

            <pagetext>40      the hearts of our compatriots abroad leap to the sounds  of rejoicing, or sink at the notes of sorrow.        Each has his sufferings, all are men,        Condemned alike to groan ;      The feeling, for another's pain,        The unfeeling, for his own.        Lend not your ear, Sir, I beseech you, to the counsel  of those who advise to make more numerous the alien's  sorrows, by dooming his body to be cut and hacked,  should his spirit take flight therefrom, while he is a pilgrim  and sojourner in (to him) a foreign country.     There are other sources which, if combined, might  prove enough for every demand. The first of these  is to be found in that class which lay violent hands  upon themselves-SUICIDES. It has of late become a  habit to whine and cant over the Felo-de-se; and the  salutary rigour of the law has been relaxed, out of compassion  to that interesting object, who, loathing the  society of his kind, rushed uncalled and unprepared  into the presence of his Judge: but I own I have no  sympathy with him, whom even the last extremity of  human distress can tempt to put a period to his mortal  existence. I pity his friends, it is true; for to them  the legacy he bequeaths is that immitigable grief which  results from the dire conviction that the soul of the  deceased is irrecoverably lost, irremediably ruined.  Him I consider a criminal dyed with the blackest  guilt-a being whose example is most pernicious-a  man, if man he may be called, whose name deserves to  be branded with everlasting infamy-and whose body  has no title to be laid amongst the bodies of Christian  men. One objection is adverse to this view. I mean  that notion, far too popular now-a-days, that no one  would be guilty of suicide if he were not at the time  insane,-which I deny ; for I do not believe that God

            <pagetext>41      so abandons those, whose minds he permits to linger  in this world benighted, that Satan finds them easy to  be persuaded to cut short that life themselves which all  the world knows the madman and the idiot cling to  more than other men. I consider it a false and wicked  libel upon the goodness of the Deity, and reject it accordingly.  Nor is my opinion without a strongly  corroborative fact in profane history. The act of selfmurder  was at one time alarmingly prevalent among  the Roman matrons. The Roman Senate, terrified at  the extensive sway of so unnatural a disposition, assembled  to deliberate upon the matter, and with a wisdom  truly honourable to them, decided that the naked body  of every woman who should in future die by her own  hands, was to be exposed to the gaze of the populace.  Henceforth, the deed, thus wedded to degradation and  public scorn, ceased to be fashionable, and female  suicide became as rare as before it had been a frequent  occurrence. I would not affirm, that if every suicide's  body, throughout Great Britain, were, irrespective of  rank, station, or sex, to be given over to the surgeons  for dissection, so very palpable a decrease would take  place in the number of self-murders ; but I do believe,  that many, very many, whom neither the love of man  nor the fear of man's Maker, mould deter from committing  the above crime, might be most effectually  deterred by the idea of having to undergo dissection  afterwards; and this, too, I know,-in Scotland, where  suicide is justly regarded as a crime, never mistaken for  madness ; and where no coroner's court exists to pronounce  those guilty thereof insane, out of regard for their  wealthy and titled connections, there are much fewer  who perish in that way than do so in England. It is  readily admitted, that the superior religious education  of the Scotch poor, may be one cause of this-but another  is to be found in the fact, that, the Scotch are a

            <pagetext>42      reflecting people, and seldom misuse words. They  have a proneness to call things by the names belonging  to them. If a man loses his life in a duel, they say he  has been murdered. If one commits suicide, they speak  of him as a self-murderer.     It may be also objected, that the feelings of surviving  relatives must be respected, and that these will have  suffered sufficiently, without having their sensibilities  harrowed by the mangling of their poor friend's body.  I grant it all; they have endured not enough only, but  more, much more than enough ; yet I do not forget by whom  their sufferings were entailed, or for whom their sorrows  are borne-a selfish wretch, who, during his life-time,  took little thought concerning them, and is unworthy  of their grief when he dies. Yet, who is it ever dreamed  of not hanging a murderer, for the sake of sparing pain  to his innocent friends? If the objection have any force  whatever, why were not the emotions of that whiteheaded  honourable old man, whose misfortune it was to  call John Thurtell-son, thus taken into consideration ?  Why were not the feelings attended to of that unhappy  wife, all deserving as she was a better fate, who, cheated  into marrying the adulterous assassin, William Corder,  was yet fated to hear of his public doom, and to know  that nothing might avert the blow of the executioner? It  were but a similar folly to get up a petition praying His  Majesty to spare the life, or even to remit that part of  the sentence assigning to the surgeons the body of the  incarnate fiend William Burke, in order to save from  outrage and violence the tender sympathies of his dear,  affectionate Helen M'Dougal       The last objection is yet behind, the only one at all  likely to prove fatal to my recommendation, since, if this  latter were to be acted upon by the legislature, the rich,  the powerful, and the mighty must submit to the same  punishment as the poor, the feeble, and the helpless.

            <pagetext>43      There would be no longer any ability vested in the  coroner and his venal jury, to pronounce verdicts of  temporary derangement in the cases of a Londonderry,  a Whitbread, and a Romilly, men as sane as I am; and  to declare each plebeian clod-pated imitator of these  gentlemen, felo-de-se   The peer and the peasant, who  chose to cut their own throats, would have to lie down  together in the unstately dissecting-room.     Notwithstanding these remarks, the result of my deliberate  conviction that the objection hee stated will  alone prevent the appropriation of the bodies of all  suicides for the purposes of anatomical instruction, I  enter my protest against the judgment of that man who  shall deem me capable of withholding from rank and  station the respect which is their due. I am neither a  radical nor a leveller, if indeed the terms be not synonimous.  Rudeness to a nobleman I would not be guilty of  intentionally, though it were to convince a world of my  independence, but neither would I pretend to read in  his patent of nobility any warrant to commit crime with  impunity. My rule of conduct is to submit myself to  every lawful superior-and  render honour to whom  honour belongs.  But I cannot respect a criminal, let  the circle in which he moves be what it may-and  never desire to look upon wealth, talents, or titles as  extenuants of the iniquities practised by their possessors-  advantages they certainly are, both rich and rare,  which entitle all who use them well to my deference and  honour-nevertheless, if I see their meritricious glare  flung across the eyes of justice to dazzle her from a clear  perception, and so to pervert her righteous judgment,  all the man within me revolts from being more than  civil to those by whom such things are attempted. I  call upon you, Sir, who have influence enough within,  and popularity enough beyond the walls of St. Stephen's  Chapel, to overcome every such species of opposition,

            <pagetext>44        (trusting that my call will not in vain solicit you,) to  weigh carefully the conflicting arguments for and against  a measure calculated more than any other with which I  am acquainted to reduce the frequency of a deed dreadfully  sinful in itself, and more injurious to society than  any other in the entire catalogue of transgressions.     A second source from which  subjects  might be obtained,  is discoverable in the bodies of all persons, no  matter what their crime, who suffer the punishment of  death. Why should any of these be spared ?-why, if  the offences of a Fauntleroy made him worthy of death,  should his body, after it was strangled, have been so  ceremoniously handed over to his dishonoured family,  to be deposited in a sepulchre beside the ashes of those  who lived respected and died lamented ? Why not  rather have desspatched it, (whether in cart or coffin,  to be left to his friends,) forthwith to the dissectingroom,  where it would have served some more useful  purpose dead than it was wont to do living? Why  should the coiner, the burglar, the highway robber,  with a host of others, the penalty of whose crimes is  death, be given over, after hanging the appointed time,  to their brother knaves instead of to the public, whom  they warred against all their lives ? The state derives  none other benefit from the death of a citizen than the  supposed deterring effect afforded by the example of  his dying, and even that admits of so much doubt, that  many good and great men have looked upon capital  punishments, except in cases of murder, as worse than  useless : so long as capital punishments do exist, however,  why should not those that undergo them be afterwards  delivered over to the teachers and students of  anatomy ?-the medical profession, the nation, the  world would be the gainers. It is certain, if the  bodies of men like these be not so made use of, the  remains of those who descended to their graves un-

            <pagetext>45      stained with guilt, will be disturbed, conveyed away,  and dissected. With a choice of evils, supposing (what  I do not think) both to be evils, is it not wisdom to  take the least ? and which is the least cannot be doubtful,  any more than whether the family of the honest  man or that of the rogue, is to have priority, when it  may become necessary for the good of the community  to decide upon plans the execution of which must be  attended with pain to some party or other.     A third mode of supply, in reality more questionable  than either of the two just discussed, offers in the  number of convicts dying in prison. No man can affect  to suppose that, with only half the forfeit in these instances  paid, justice is nevertheless satisfied. And if  any argue that vengeance ceases when life is closed, I  reply, the law does not meditate vengeance at all, but  satisfaction, when it -can be obtained, for the injured  party, and the reformation, when it can be effected, of  the party by whom the injury was done. It may be  urged, that for many offences the punishment would be  disproportioned. This objection I deem any thing but  valid ; not to remark on the absurdity of pronouncing that  a punishment which touches not the living but the dead.  I may observe, it will be fairer to view the proposed  good to be derived, and to compare it with the ill consequences  expected to accrue from any undertaking,  than to set in array against it all possible objections,  without any regard to the contingent advantages, and  vice versa. That the greatest good would result to the  community from an adequate supply, by legislative provision,  of subjects, to meet the wants of medical students  and instructors, cannot be disputed ; for church-yard  robberies, with all their attendant horrors would cease;  with the annihilation of the resurrectionist's trade, the  gangs of desperate men, trusting at present to it for  subsistence, would be dissolved; surgeons, whose sta-

One evil I certainly should fear as likely to follow  the adoption of my third proposal. In all cases of jail  sickness, it might tend to increase the disorder, by  affecting the patient's imagination. But even this  objection is not so solid as it appears plausible. A  familiarity with crime hardens the heart, and those who  brave the gallows incur small peril of being appalled  by the dissectingroom. After making every deduction  for the feelings of the dying felon, (and with his feelings  I would no more trifle than with my brother's,) the  value of the method recommended, as one whereby, in  conjunction with other two, all existing difficulties in  the way of anatomical instruction might be abolished,  remains but little lessened. More than two-thirds of  those by whom our criminal prisons, including the  hulks, are occupied, however startling the assertion  may appear to some, are persons who from earliest infancy  were trained to acts of rapine and plunder-upon  whom the lights of our holy religion were, by their infernal  preceptors, never suffered to shine, or shone only  to be again swallowed up in thick darkness-in whose  bosoms the fires of humanity and benevolence were  never kindled, or, if kindled, not kept alive so long as  to warm their own minds, or to prompt them to do  good to their fellow-men. In health, their chains serve  them but for pastime; their cells merely furnish them  with leisure to recapitulate and exult over their depre-

If laid  upon the bed of sickness, are sin, righteousness, and  judgment the terrors which haunt their minds and distract  their thoughts? Alas   ignorant of these, they  resemble devils more than men, when disease distresses  them. Many of them, if addressed, will display their  ingenuity by defending their iniquities ; and more, cannot  be persuaded of having done any wrong in the sight  of God, since by man they were taught all they have  done, long before they were capable of discerning good  from evil   For example, how stubborn and obstinate  is the smuggler in withholding the acknowledgment  that he has erred   How light the utterer of base coin  esteems his offence in comparison with that of the highway-  robber   How venial does the pickpocket think his  crime, and how indignant if it be hinted in his hearing  that he is not a much less heinous offender than his burglarious  neighbour, who, scowling on less daring rogues,  thanks God he is not a murderer   And is it conceivable  that they who have often hazarded life in place of relinquishing  plunder, are, notwithstanding, to be so scared,  when sick and ill, by the vision of a dissecting-table, as  to give up the ghost earlier than they else would?  Among the signs of the times, that is not the least  ominous, which is seen in the tender sympathy lavished  upon knaves and vagabonds, while honest men and  labourers starve by the wayside, unnoticed and unpitied.  I honour the name-revere the memory of a Howard    give more than worship, more than reverence to his  woman-rival, Caroline Fry   and drop the humble  meed of my sincere applause at the door of the Society

            <pagetext>48        for Improving Prison Discipline, for I, too, earnestly  long for the amendment of the wicked, and fervently  pray for the conversion of the sinner  -but, did John  Howard, does Mrs. Fry, or does the excellent Society  following their footsteps, meditate the abolition of  punishmeat while crime lasts ? or recommend the desuetude  of fetters, while prisoners continue refractory ?  No-nor is there sufficient ground for cavilling at the  proposal to send the bodies of all dead convicts to the  several schools of anatomy throughout Great Britain.     If this principle be admitted,   By whomsoever  society has been injured, society may reasonably demand  to be benefited whenever the opportunity occurs,  I  think it will not be denied that she is always more or  less a sufferer by suicides, felons under sentence of  death, and all other convicts. A way by which these  may be made in some degree useful, when dead, is by  the dedication of their bodies to the furtherance of  anatolmcal studies, consequently to the advancement of  medical science, and to the amlioration of human  misery. It remains to be seen if this or any similar  plan will meet with the approval of the legislature, that  the blood-thirsty man may no longer prevail, nor murder  for the sake of a corpse be any more accomplished.     I profess to be ignorant of any other classes of individuals,  to the possession of whose dead bodies the  community can be said to have a clear title. Certainly  to none, who, when permitted to be at large, are presumed  to be innocent of crime, may justice, science, or  humanity pretend so fair a claim as to those who terminate  their own exisntence; those who forfeit it by the  perpetration of unlawful deeds; and those who in process  of punishment happen to die. These all are  public offenders, and, in a measure, public property,  The question, the only question remaining, is as to the  relative advantage of abandoning such for worms to

I have thus, Sir, brought to its close, a letter which  nothing had induced me to trespass upon your notice  but a sense of duty overpowering all my reluctance, and  urging me as with a spur to join my voice to that of the  multitude.     The propriety of availing myself of the present time,  while the popular mind is yet in a ferment, coupled with  the fact, that of Burke's iniquities I was totally ignorant  until the 4th instant, has compelled me to write quickly,  and, as far as style was concerned, carelessly. I am  not, however, aware of having been hurried into a single  erroneous statement, by the necessity I felt myself  under of hastily composing my thoughts on so consequential  a subject.     The portable library of a naval surgeon yields few  materials for either the elucidation of facts or the adorning  a narrative. I have written what I have written  from the stores supplied me by memory, or the recollections  furnished me by experience.     Nor is the corporeal debility, occasioned by disease,  altogether favourable to the putting forth one's entire  mental strength. These pages have been penned while  I laboured under a trying indisposition; and I have  not been able to complete them without occasionally  pausing for the remission of actual pain. Copiousness  of language and elegance of composition, they will  necessarily want. I hope the absence of such will be  in some measure atoned for by a merit which it cannot  be denied me this epistle does possess. While I wrote  it, it was with a consciousness that it might be my last  earthly labour, and therefore with an abiding religious  fear; hence, I have endeavoured to affirm nothing of

I do not flatter you, Sir, when, in conclusion, I beg to  express my perfect readiness to leave the questions now  feebly discussed by me, to your decision; and, at the  same time, to state my conviction that you will, without  reluctance, and without delay, proceed to make all the  proper inquiries concerning a matter alike important to  the nation, and connected with that department of  which in this country you are at once the ornament and  the head.   I have the honour to subscribe myself, with the utmost  respect,       SIR,         Your most obedient,                Very humble Servant,              A MEDICAL OFFICER IN THE ROYAL NAVY.

Since his condemn;uioil this unhappy man was perfectly penitent  : r,d resigned to his fate. He never deluded himself with any  hopes of escape or mercy ; and accorilinglv'.' .h e immediatelT pre- pared himself for confessioa and for rece+vmg absolution, by  of such books as his spiritual guidea had put into his hands,  and by listening with the most devout attention to their religious  inwructions. He fully acknowledged the justice of h  sentence ;  nay, 11e consitfered it in somemeasure as a SLessing, thecertainty of  his 3pproachlng fate having brought back his mind to 3 true sense  of religion, fr-om which it had been foug estranged, and he wished  to die ai pesce with all men. IEe  nads a full confessian of all the  nlurcters he was guilcv of, canclescending on no Zeus than sixteen  persons, heginning with old Abigail   i   sonf,r om Lornhead, and  ending with Marjory Campbell or Dochei4cy, and all witlin the short  space of nine months ; mentioning their names, sex, ad ages, in  so far ;ts he knew them, and the date at which thy were dispatched,  which was g-eneraily by soffoeation, as well as towhom sold,  and the price received for the bodies. He said they all made very  little resistance, being ge erallyi,f not always, very much intoxicated  with spirits. What induced him to commence this harrible traffc  in blood, war, he said, Hare and him having 'received 67, 10s. for  the body of an old pensioner who died in IEa+e's house, and which,  at Hare's suggestion, they took to Surgeons Square.  Accordingly, about eight this morning, hc was waited upon by the officiating  Magistrate8 at the Lock-up-house, where he had previously been brought from Jail,  and soon after proceeded to the scaffold up Libberton Wynd, attended by two aqfllolicC  lergymen. After sometime spent in prayer kneeling, he-mounted the fatal  drop, (after shaking hands with thase around him,) the rope being then adjusted*  :hd the cap drawn over his Lce, in a few moments gaie the6signal, and was instantly  launched into eternity. After hanging the usual time he was eut down, and sent to  the GMege far dissection.  PRICE ONE P E M .

            <pagetext>Lines  SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY  MRS WILSON,  Daft Jamie's Mother,  On assertaining the Way and Manner her son had  been basely Murdered in the West Port, by  WILLIAM MB BURKE and WILLTAM HARE.    O my son, why did you wander,  Why so far away from home;  It was love to me, your mother,  Caused you so far to roam.    You was simple, inoffensive,  Loved by all where e'er you went,  And their little bounties cheered you,  And their smiles made you content.    When you met your neighbour cronies,  Take er give a snuff would ye,  With your box and spoon sae happy,  To prime their noses aye so free.    But, O ill ill fated morning,  That you sought your mother dear,  Wandering through the Grassmarket,  Without either dread or fear,    But cruel monsters they had eyed You,  And had marked you for their 'prey;  To their horrid den decoyed you,  And with whisky paved the way.    O, my heart, how does it shudder,  At the deeds confessed and done,  That have been committed by them,  Monsters in the human form.    Who could for the love of money  Tarn the living into dead,

            <pagetext>And thus prepare for the dissector,  Subjects to supply his need.    Love of money,root of evil,-  Cause of all the murders done,  And other crimes more horrid  Than the murder of my son.    Encouraged by those that bought them,  Still to bring them plenty more ,  Never questioned how they got them,  Though their hands were stained in gore.    You who bought and used his body,  Surely you was much to blame,  In concealing thus a murder,  For you must have known the same.    If your conscience had allowed you,  But for once the truth to tell,' '  But the craft had been in danger,  Had you stopped these imps of Hell.    Blood guilty wretches though concealed,  For a time your crimes have been,  Justice has you overtaken,  And your guilt must all be seen.    But justice still demands that you  Of your crimes should make confession,  Before you on a gibbet high  To the law make restitution.    May your repentance be sincere,  And your crimes be all forgiven,  All your guilt be cancell'd here,  And at last be found in Heaven      Is the prayer of,  c.    Price One Penny.    N. B.-There will be published on Monday first, by W.  SMITH, Bristo Port, a Laconic Narrative of the Life adn Death  of Poor Daft Jamie; to which will be added, a few Anecdotes  relative to him, and his old friend BoBY Awl :-Price Thrip Pence  Pw.-The work will be embellished with a striking Portrait  of Jamie.

            <pagetext>Nae mother's life, or idiot boy,       By suffocating skill,     A Paterson ill nae mair choke,       Or shot will e'er he kill.     On the infant child his savage eye,       Determin'd hand was bent,     Alcho' it smil'd up in his face,       His heart did not relent.     But worse than a' Barbarian,       Tho' it prattled on his knee,     No age nor sex, spare none, he said,       A subject it should be.     At a close they ca' St Cuthbert's,       The head of the Wast Port,     A; girl he seized to be his prey,       But miss'd his vile effort.     He poor Daft Jamie didna miss,       But did him so betray,     Regardless of his lunacy       He took his life away.     His doom is seal'd forever now,       Nae mair in Scotia's isle,     Nae cursed plans will mair contrive,       Poor wretches to beguile.     His body's here-his soul's awa;       To where we canna tell,     At ony rate, to Doctor K* *,       Hell nae mair subjects sell.           EPITAPH,     Now Burke's away, his life's extinct,       And past a' men's protection,     He's made a subject now himself,       His body's for dissection.     Poor Willie, if his soul be weel,       It's mair-than what's expecit,     For by his deeds, (if we may judge),       By him it was neglecit.     But some fo'k thinks it has nae chance,       In Heaven for to dwell,     If that's the case, there's ae thing sure,       It is consign'd to H-ll                            BY A. COUNTRYMAN.                   PRICE ONE PENNY.

            <pagetext>SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE BENEFIT  OF  JAMES GRAY AND HIS WIFE.    A LETTER  TO THE  EDITOR OF THE CALEDONIAN MERCURY.                          EDINBURGH, 15th January 1829.  Sir,   I am happy to see that your brother Journalists have spoken in  proper terms of the zeal, industry and talent, which your paper has lately  displayed; and it must no doubt be a high gratification to you, to see  that the country at large feels itself deeply indebted for the unceasing efforts  and unwearied spirit of intelligence displayed in its columns, ever  since the discovery of Burke and his atrocious associates.   Permit me therefore, Sir, to hope that you will not leave the good work  unfinished;- and in the meantime, may I ask you to call forth public gratitude  in the shape of a handsome subscription for the benefit of James  Gray and his wife. All who have read or may read the trial of Burke and  M'Dougal, must see the immense importance of their testimony-in fact,  could they have been bribed not to inform about the dead body, * these  murderous fiends, Burke and Hare, aided and abetted by their miscreant  female companions, would still have been pursuing their dark deeds of  blood.   I know that the Editor of the   Edinburgh Evening Courant,  has  has been written to by the Publishers of the authentic edition of Burke's  Trial, in behalf of Gray and his wife, (who have a young child, as you are  aware); and although they have had Subscription Books ** lying open in their  Shops for a week past, and this has been advertised in three of the principal  papers, yet, strange to say, (notwithstanding all own the propriety  of the measure, and many were eager in their promises before the good  work was begun), not even Ten Ponnds have heen collected.   Gray has got a situation in the Police, and intends, should sufficient  funds be raised, to open a small shop for his wife, paying the first year's  rent, and the stock necessary to start with, out of the subscription  money; surely it is not being too sanguine in trusting this may be done.     *   They did not think that murder had been committed, consequently this shews  their honest feelings could not be bought to wink even at theft. M'Doughal has had  two children by Mrs Gray's father.   **  Any respectable Bookseller,  c. wishing to join in this, may have a Subserip.  tion Book, on application to any of the publishers.

Because God's law I  d transgress,  And woyld rfot walk thereil;,  But fled the paths of righteousness,  And trod the path8 of sin,  These shocking murders harrass zhp sucl,  Which cruelly t've commit egi,  For paltry.gain, which ne er lasts 'tong,  With those who basely get it.  When first I began this wiid career,  Taas with the o d  e,psiuner,  Who died a natural death last yeav,  Bur did not obtaih a sepulchre.  The bddy we brougb; to Surgeons Square  Soon got a ready market fort,  And eacourbg'd thus to bring some more,   he rest soon foliowed after it.  Feur were chok'd in Broggan s house,  Though Broggan clid ilot know,  And four were murder'd in my house,  Wbich caused my overthrow.  Six victi'ms mora in Ware's house,  Were suffocated too ;  Besides two pthqr victims in his srab.lu,  Which I most sincerely rue.  My sentence, therefore, must be just,  Fer Cod's commandment taps,  He that sheddeth another's blood,  His blood must it appqase.  0, thedore, holison of God,  Do thou my soul reliev e,  From Cod's wmtb and afflicting rod,  I hat nok mj'soul doth grieve ;  Oa thy redempr;on I depend.  0, cast me oo .wway,;  But shield am? soul, and me defend  Agaiw t  hi evil pay.

            <pagetext>HARE'S  DREAM   Describing the Appari -  tions of Burke and others,  which appeared to him  while in the Calton Jail.    Good people all give ear to what I say,    'Twill make your very blood run cold,  And fill you with dread dismay,    When the truth to you I've told.  The criers of sixteen murdered souls    Does still ring in my ears,  And through my cell one voice it rolls,    Which haunts my mind with fears,  Crying, William Hare, I beware    Of the approaching day,  When earthly joys and earthly care    Must then be thrown away.  It is for near a long long year,    You have led a murdering life,  Without either dread or fear,    'Midst rioting and strife.  Last night as I lay on my bed,    And sleeping I was sound,  Strange fancies then came in in my head.    Which much did me confound.  Me thought I wander'd on the street,    And singing very crouse,  Till with a man I chanc'd to meet,    and led him to my house.  When to the house I led him in,    To him I seen'd a brother,  To give him whisky did begin,-    When drunk I did him smother.  I dragg'd him by the lint white locks,    While Burke was standing by

            <pagetext>And put him in to a large box,    Then for the Doctor Burke did fly.  I thought the flesh fell off his bones,    Then as a skeleton he did appear,  It vanish'd in its dying groans,    Which fill'd me with great fear.  Then I awoke but sleep'd again,    O horror   what a sight,  The child that I one night had slain,    In an angel's form shone bright.  You've come, sweet angel, heavenly bright,    To tell me of my crime,  Why thus disturb me here to-night,    And at no other time.  Next Burke appear'd within my cell,    Chain'd with the murderer's fetter,   Hear, Hare, hear, what I've to tell,    Try change your life for better.  O William Hare with me bewail,    Turn from your evil ways,  I say this from my lips in jail,    Hark what a murderer says.    I thought my liberty I had got,    But with sorrow was deceiv'd,  For when in jail that I 'awoke,    Still was there unrelieved.  O cruel and bloody that I was,    To think on killing men,  And that without the slightest cause,    Decoyed them to my den.  Such thoughts as these were what I made,    After that I had awoke,  But let it ne'er again be said,    That there lives such a rogue.  O silent sleep,-I'll ne'er sleep again,    To think on't makes me shiver;  What tortures and what cruel pain,--    Forget it shall I never.  And whether in night's silent hour,    Or in the sun shine day,  Still will remain at my mind's door,    Till I the debt of nature pay.                    PRICE ONE PENNY.

            <pagetext>West-Port Murders.  CHARACTERS  OF  BURK, HARE, AND DR. KNOX.   From the Noctes Ambrosiane of Blackwood's Magazine  for March 1829.1  BEING PART OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN NORTH, TICKLER,  AND THE ETTRIcE SHEPHERD.  Shepherd.-Did you ever see sic a preparation o' a skeleton  o' a turkey ? We maun send it to the College Museum,  to staun in a glass case aside Burk's.  North.-What did you think, James, of the proceedings  of these two Irish gentlemen?  Sbep7rerd.-That the were too monotonous too impress the  imagination. First ae drunk auld wife, and then anither  drunk auld wjfe-and then a third drunk auld wife--and  then a drunk auld or sick man or twa, The confession got  unco monotonous-the Lights and Shadows o' Scottish  Death want relief-though, to be sure, poor Peggy Paterson,  that Unfortunate, broke in a little on the uniformity; and  sae did Daft Jamie; for whilk last murder, without ony  impiety, ane may venture to say, the Devil is at this moment  ruggin' that Burk out o' hell fire wi' a three-prong'd fork,  and then in wit him again, through the ribs-and then stirring  up the coals wi' that eternal poker-and then wi' the  great bellows blawin' up the furnace, till, like an Etna, or  Mount Vesuvius, it vomits the murderer out again far ower  into the very middle o' the floor o' the infernal regions.  1 . hienzies, Printer, Edinburgh.

He was ready to laygh, and leer, and claw hie elbow, at  every question put to him which he did not comprehend,  or in which he thought he head something funny; his  sleep, he said, was always sound, and that he never dreamed  none;  he was much tickled by the question, '  Did he  believe in ghosts ?  or   Did he ever see any in the dark     and gobbled out, grinning d l the while a brutal laugh, an  uncouth expressioa sf contempt tor such foolery-and  then muttering c( thank God -words he used more than  once--callously, ancf stillenly, and vacantly as to their meaning,  he thought-  that he had done nought to be afeared  for ;  his dialect being to our ears a sort of slovenly mixture  of the lower than the lowest  Irish, and the most brutelike  of the mort sunken Coomberland.

Natfr.-Poor, miserable, boney, skinny, scranky, wizened  jades both, without the niost distant approach to good-lookingness,  either in any part of their forms, or any feature of  their face--peevish, sulky, savage, and cruel, and evidently  familiar, from earliest life, with all the woe and wretchedness  of guilt and polIution-most mean in look,man ier,mind,  dress-the very dregs of the dregs of prostitution. Hare  has most of the she-devil.

In including the three chargee im  one indictment, his Lordship was influenced solely by that  feeling for the prisoners, which a humane and enlightened  man may entertain even for the most atrocious criminal,  consistently with justice. Their counsel chose otherwise,  and the event was the same. The attempt to try Hare, at  first appeared to me infamous; but in that I shewed my  ignorance, for Mr Sandford made out a strong case ; but Mr  Macneil's masterly argument Was irresistible, and the decision  of the Judges entirely right-although I do not say  that the view of the law so ably given by Lor  Alloway  and Gillies was wrong. As to any wish in any quarter to  ahape the proceedings so as to shield Dr Knox, that idea is  mere childishness and absurdity, and fit only for the old  women whom Rurk and Hare did not murder.'  Shepherd-I'm glad to hear o' that, air ; and: dnci? you  say't, it maun be true. But what o' Dr Knox? ,   North.-The system established and acted on ia, the dissecting-  rooms of that anatomist is manifestly of the most savage,  brutal, and dreadfill character. It is albwed by all  parties, that not a single question was ever put-or  + ever,  mere mockery-to the wretches who came week after  week with uninterred bodies crammed into. tea-ches k-but  that each corpse was eagerly received, and fresh orders issued  for more. Nor; is there any reason to,bdieve, bu-t every  reason to believe the contrary, that h a the mtlderers  brought sixty instead of sixteen murilerecT c ses, they  would not have met an instant market.  Shepherd-Fearsome-fearsome    Tickler.- We shall suppose, then, that not a shade, however  slight, of suspicion ever crossed Dr Knox's rni ld,o r  the minds of his assistants. What follou. ? That they  knew that the poorer inhabitants of Edinburgh were all of  them not only willing, but most eager to sell the bodies of  their husbands. wives, brothers, and sisters, and sweethearts,  and relations in general ; for if these two miscreants could,  in little more than eight months, purchase from vff the  deathbed sixteen corpses, pray how many might have been  purchased in that time a sufficient number of agents ?  Unless the practice of selling the dead were almost universal,  and known by Dr Knox a  hdis assistants to be so, un,  - -

Shepherd.--he thing's plain-that whatever mag be the  case wi' ither anatomists, here or elsewhere, Dr Knox at  least has nae right to ca' on the legislature for some leg71  provi ion for the procurin' o' dead l)odies for dissection.  The legislature, on the ither hand, has a better right to ca'  on him for a revision o' the laws regulatin' his ain system.  Some writers, I see, Llame the magistrates o'   d i n b u r   h ,  and some the polish, and some the London Parliament  House, for a' thae murders-but I carrna help blamm', especially,  Burk and Hare---and neist to them Dr Knox and his  assista its. Naebody believes in ghosts in touns, but every  body believes in ghosts in the kintra. Let either Hare or  Knox sleep a' night in a lanely wood, wi' the wund roarin'  in the tap branches o' the pines, and cheeping in the side  anes, and by skreich o' day he will be seen ffyin' wi' his  hair on end, and his een jiullpin' out ow their sockets, doon  into the nearest toon, pursued, as he thir ks, by saxteen  ghaists a' in a row, wi' Daft Jamie at their head, caperin'  like a paralytic as he was, and lauching like to split, wi' a  mouth drawn a' to the ae side, at the doctor or the doctor's  man, distracted at the sicht o' sae mony spirits demandin'  back their ain atomies.

On leaving 3fuiravonside Burke and his  paramour went to the east country to the harvest.  When the shearing was concluded, he came into  Edinburgh and lodged some time with a man  of the name of Cullen, who then resided in the  West Port. He had acquired a partial knowledge  of shoe-mending while in the militia, but  being utterly unknown, he got very little or  rather no employment. He repaired to Leith  in search of work, and wrought some time with  an eccentric character, Charles McGranachaa,  a countryman sf his owl. He soon tired of  M6GranachanYs heavy work and small wages,  and he went and laboured in the wuntry. He  ex:ng.aged again on the carnal near Winsburgh,  * but left it and went a second time to the harvest.  He next resided in Peebles for some time, where  he wrought on the roads, or took jobs at hedging,  ditching, and trenching, and 'was, in short, considered  an industrious and efficient sort of masterof-  all-work in the labouring way.

The usual preparations being completed,  Burke sprung like iz tiger on his unauspmting  victim ; he w u then only a novice in mar -  the struggle was severe, but humanity would  shrink at the appaling details. While Burke  was in the Lock-up after his conviction, in  alluding to the great dificg1t.y he experienced in  bereaving this unhappy mman oE life, he stated   at  for a long time after he h d murdered  his first victim, he found it attetly impossible to  banish for a single hour the recollection of the  fatal struggle, the screams of distre3s and despair,--  the ag nisirng groans,--zand all the redities  of the dreadfnl dead. At rGght the bloody  tragedy, accompanied by frightfa1 viaions ef  supernatural beings, tormented him in his dreams,  For a long time he shuddered at fie thought of  being alone in the dark--during thenight he kept  a light conti udlyb urning hy his bed side, but  he ultimately became so mllons, that a murder  aclded but little to his mental anguish.  He  was a man of remarkably otrorlg passions-he  was good tempered-+ no mans of a qnarrelsome  disposition, but d e n once raised into a  passion, he became altogether ungovernable--  deaf to reason and utterly reckless, he raged  like 3 fmy, and t .  me him was ago- easy task,  Such in .a few words have been the principal  incidents in the life of William Bnrke.

The body was discovered  next morning bv a man r l a d Grtiy, who had  been s lodger the house ; upgn whose information,  Burke and M'D ugal, together with  Hare arid his Wife, were apprehended, end  after examination, were indicted to stand trial  before the high court of Justiciary on Wednesday.  the 2dt'n .December.  ; On that-day the prisoners were brought from  the Calton-hi1 Jail at an early hour, and had G  most wretched Pppearanee at the bar.

Hie death struagle was  brief, notwithstanding that, either fibm tile nnrPkilfulnem  of the executioner, or thz chanp rf  pos tion on the part of the murderer Aimwff, the  knot of the noose had slipped from c lderh is a r  to behind his neck ; and he evidendy died, 8ke  his own victims, from srrffoeation done. He  gave several convulsive heaves however, ta each  of which the spectators rqonded by mother  shout of triumph, appearing to gloat o m the dying  agonies of this miserable and moat guilty  man. The vengeance of the mob seemed to  have been satiated with the death of the criminal,  and the shouts, though renewed at intervals,  gradually became fainter and fainter. After remaining  suspended for exactly three quarters of  an hour, the body was lowerecl down, arnidst the  renovated shouts of the populace, into :a rude cof  i n , and immnediately carried on the shoulders of  men to the Lock-up-house, in order to be thcraafter  conveyed to Dr Munro's Anatomical  Theatre, which took place at an early hour on  Thursday morning.  Essentklly and in his real character an ignoble,  base, and mean-spirited wretch, this wholesale  assassin, by the mere extinction or o5litcration  of every moral principle of his natr ;e, and by a  coneequeut zbandonmeqt of the faculties' bestowed  upon him b the coml issioa of crime, has suc-  , ceeded in obtaining 66 a bacl prc-eininence,  even ,  among those who had prostituted and degraded   r higher endowments tcs the ways of iniquity ;
