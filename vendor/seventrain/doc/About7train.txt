General

The 7train transformation process is designed to produce METS objects
from standardized XML files. This scenario was composed by Paul Fogel
and Erik Hetzner at the California Digital Library (CDL) and is
copyright the University of California Regents.

Overview
--------

The 7train tool was designed to transform XML documents into METS
objects conforming to a specified METS profile. This particular
implementation has the goal of transforming CONTENTdm XML exports into
METS suitable for inclusion in CDL systems. However, the tool can be
customized to process any kind of XML documents (ex. OAI records,
etc.) and produce METS of any flavor. See Customization below.

7train.xsl is the base stylesheet in the transformation and defines
the basic elements and structure of a METS file. Local installations
can customize this process by creating a stylesheet that imports
7train.xsl and overrides certain templates. The “cdm.xsl” stylesheet
(in the default implementation) is an example of a local installation
designed to transform a specific XML file (CONTENTdm export) into a
specific kind of METS.

The files included in this distribution are as follows:

  7train.xsl
    this is the stylesheet that constructs the basic METS sections; it
    does not attempt to define values for elements or attributes

  cdm.xsl
    this primary stylesheet defines how the values in the original XML
    document will be transformed; in addition, it determines the
    structure and values for the METS sections defined in 7train.xsl

  xwalker.xsl
    this stylesheet contains the logic that processes the mappings
    defined in \*.xwalk to populate metadata sections in the METS
    (mainly the <dmdSec>)

  cdmmd2dc.xwalk
    this document defines the mappings between the original XML
    elements to the desired metadata schema

    the directory to hold input documents - the original XML, etc.

  idmap.xml
    an identifier map file

    a CDL-specific map file

  examples/
    the directory where example files are contained; currently holds
    only oai.xsl

  oai.xsl
    found in the examples/ directory; this file provides a basic OAI
    record to METS conversion
