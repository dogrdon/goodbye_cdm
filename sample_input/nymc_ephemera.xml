        <pagetext>Text of interior leaves reads: br  HELP FEED THE BOYS br   OVER THERE  br  br  It's up to YOU and ME and the rest of US to substitute br  MILK  CREAM br  BUTTER br  CHEESE  DRY MILK br  br  FOR THOSE FOODS SO NECESSARY FOR THE PHYSICAL UPKEEP br  OF THE FIGHTING MEN AT THE FRONT br  AND THOSE OF OUR ALLIES  br  br  You are not asked to make a sacrifice but merely to  br use more abundantly a food that is more beneficial to your well-being than any other. br Milk and milk products are not only the most br  NOURISHING but the CHEAPEST food on the  br  market to-day. br  br  Milk is a substitute for other foods. No other food br  is a substitute for milk. br  br  Use whole milk. Use skimmed milk. Use butter- br milk.  Use every form of good, clean milk. br  br  In one quart of mik there is as much energy as is  br  contained in three-quarters of a pound of meat. br  br  The Women of the Nation have it in their power to br  spread the absolute need of Food Conservation to the end  br  that we can spare not only imperishable foods for the br  men in the battle line but also boost milk consumption br  at home to what it was in pre-war times, thereby saving  br the coming race from physical deterioration. br  br  Remember, milk is the CHEAPEST food there is, br  and it has increased LESS in price than any other food. br  br   second page  Reasons Why the Consumption of Milk  br  Should be Increased  br  br  From the United States Department of Agriculture br  br Milk at......Is as Cheap as Sirloin Steak at......Or Eggs at br  10 cents a quart....23.3 cents a pound....25.1 cents a dozen br 12 cents a quart....27.9 cents a pound....30.2 cents a dozen br  15 cents a quart....34.9 cents a pound....37.7 cents a dozen br  br  AN AUTHORITY  br  br  Professor E. V. McCollum, of Johns Hopkins Uni- br versity, says discoveries of the past three years show that  br  there are existing in milk and some other foods two un- br known substances which stimulate growth. One of these  br  is found in the fat and the other is found in the water or  br  solution. Their chemical charcter is unknown and they br  have never been separated from the food materials with  br  which they are associated. Professor McCollum has  br  pointed out that the seeds of plants are good food so far br  as they go, but they are deficient in these growth- br promoting substances, which are found chiefly in the  br leaves of  all trees and plants. They are found in such br  leaves as cabbage, lettuce,spinach and cauliflower and  br  above all in milk.Concerning milk and milk products,  br  he says it is not generally appreciated that these articles br  have a dietary value greater than can be expressed  br  by their protein and energy contents. In experiments  br  on rats, Professors Osborne, Mendel and McCollum have  br  shown that the feeding of butter fat and of milk promotes  br growth in a remarkable way for the reason that the vita- br  mines or growth-promoting substances are present in milk  br  in an abundance and in a form which is readily available,  br  as in non other of our common foods.

        <pagetext> To the 3500 students attending the summer schools at Columbia  br   University and New York University, this bulletin is addressed, with   the belief that no subject is more worthy of thie interest and study   than New York's efforts to reduce preventable infant deaths. br  br  SEEING NEW YORK  br  br   Of course you've  seen  New  br   York. You've explored the   shops, dipped into Chinatown, br   dined at  Little Hungary,  gone   through the new library, topped   the Singer tower, visited the  br   Hall of Fame, Grant's tomb, Ellis Island, and  millionaire's   row. br  br   But we venture to claim that no one of the  sights  br   is more remarkable than the spectacle presented this summer, br   of public and private agencies banding together to prove   that babies need not die just because the weather is hot. br  br   You're naturally curious to see what sort of infant   citizen is being safely steered through the colicky stormy   stages of tenement babyhood up to the serene times when   he will come under your jurisdiction. br

        <pagetext>THROW AWAY THAT LOLY POP  br  br   Are You Teaching 'Little Mothers'? br   Did you ever think that lessons in hygiene to little girls would save baby lives? br   New York City's health department has organized 239 little mother's leagues in 162 br   schools where little girls from 12-14 take care of youonger sisters and brothers. br   Weekly meetings are held, with lectures by board of health doctors. br   If you have time step in br    PRESENT LIST OF MEETING PLACES: br   Manhattan: ...  br   The Bronx: ...  br   Brooklyn: ...  br   Queens: ...  br   Richmond: ...  br  br   IF A LITTLE MOTHER STOPS YOU  br   LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAYS: br   (Extracts from Little Mothers' Essays) br  br   What I Did for the Little Mother's League  br   The lady who Lives in the same house as we do, has a baby boy, 9 months br    old. Night after night I hear him cry. One day I asked her why he crys so. br   She said she did not know. I asked what she feeds him and she said on  br   groceries milk. I soon know why the baby crys so, it had stomach trouble. I br    asked why she doesn't keep the milk on ice and she says she cannot afford it. So  br   I gave her the address to the milk depot. I told her to tell the person in charge  br   that she cannot afford to buy ice and they will try to help her. br   The day after she went to store and the doctor told her the baby had  br   stomach trouble. He gave the baby the right milk and a ticket for ice. Since that  br   very day the baby drinks the milk, he sleeps during the night as if there were no  br   baby. She thanked me very much and said I have saved a child from suffering  br   pain and a mother from becoming ill, because when people do not sleep at night  br   they usually become sick br  br    What I Have Done for the Mother's League  br   One day as I was walking in the street I saw a baby in a carriage fast asleep  br   with a nipple and an empty bottle in its mouth. So I saw the mother from the  br   child and I told her nipples is a real death for a child. When the baby is having br    its sleep, the nipple should be in a glass of borax water ready for its meal. The  br   mother from that child thanked me very much  br  br   Another Testimony  br   One day I walked in the street and I saw a woman giving a baby a loly-pop br    which had been sucked some time by her elder son. I went over and told her that br    loly-pops or any such food was the same as giving the child some poison. She  br   asked me how I know and I told her I had learned it at the Little Mother's  br   League. She took the subject under consideration and threw the loly-pop  br   away. br  br   How I Helped the Mother's League br    My little sister does not feel well I said to mother:  Mama, baby has diaria  br   or loose bowels. Stop all milk, solid food, give her a dose of castor oil, br   and then take her to the doctor. My mother tried castor oil, by nothing helped. br   She went to the doctor, I went along to see what he would say, and what do you br    think he said, exactly what I did and added something new to it. br  br   How I Was a 'Little Mother'  br   One day when I was on the pier with my little brother, a man who took care  br   of a baby gave it a bottle of coffee. I saw the bottle was dirty and told him the br    baby would get sick. He said to me   Mind your business.  I said I belong to  br   the Little Mothers' League and know how to take care of babies. The next time  br   I saw the baby sleeping with a loly-pop in his mouth, the flies were flying on it, br   but my little brother was covered with a veil and I fanned him. The next week I br    saw the baby and he looked sick. I told the father to go to the doctor. Now he  br   took my advice and when he came back he said the baby had summer complaint, br   but in three weeks the baby was well again. I think the father will never again  br   give the baby those things. br  br   The Care of a Baby for One Day  br   It is half past six and my little brown eyed Dorothy has awaked, and the  br   first thing I must do is to give her a nice cool bath, and my  how little Dorothy  br   can kick, Now I will put on her soft clean clothes. My little Dorothy then must  br   be fed on barley and milk. I will take her to the recreation pier, how the baby is  br   enjoying it  She seems to be hungry, come we will go home, eat and come back  br   again. When I got home I undressed baby and gave her another bath the I fed  br   her again and she went asleep. When she awoke up I took her for a walk   through the park. It was getting toward evening and the sun was going down  br   so I walked home with baby slowly  br  br

From January 1st, and through July 29, this year, 888 fewer babies, under 1 year br died than for the same period in 1910 br  br  2. During the hot spell, July 1-15, br  the deaths from diarrhoeal diseases de- br creased from 576 in 1910 to 270 in 1911. br  For the two weeks ending July 29, there  br  was a continued decrease of 322 deaths br from this cause from 1910 br  br 3. For three of the city's most congest- br ed districts, where milk depots were br located, the mortality for 1910 and 1911 br is as follows: br  14th Ward...76 1910 ...11 1911  br 17th Ward...43 1910 ...20 1911  br 26th Ward...43 1910 ...11 1911  br  br  4. In 5 wards in Manhattan and 9  br wards in Brooklyn, where there are no  br stations, infant deaths were reduced only br  14  and 2  respectively during May and  br June, compared with 1910.

        <pagetext> THE HOUSE WITH THE BLUE FRONT   br  br   (From the New York Times, Sunday, May 14, 1911. br  br  br    Can you tell me the way to The House with the Blue Front? br  br   The man to whom she spoke answered at once that it was right around  the corner, And well he might, for blue is not a color habitually chosen  by New Yorkers for a house front.  br  br   Some curious purpose had dictated the choice of a color so unusual as   that which jumped at one the moment the corner was turned. The blue   was the blue of an afternoon sky. Nobody could pass such a place without stopping to look. It gripped you by the arm and held you while you pon-dered its purpose.  br  br   This is the way it is expected to work. Take a mother who has stren-  ously refused to rear her offspring along scientific lines. She gives it tea, coffee, strawberry shortcake and pickles. One day alarming symptoms   develop. The mother, whom we wish the reader to picture as hitherto  a monument of obstinacy, experiences and instant change of heart, seizes the baby, and rushes to the street.  br  br    Tell me,  she cries,  the nearest way to the house with the blue front.  br  br   The chances are 100 to 1 that somebody can give her the information instantly, and she rushes where she knows help in the form of a trained nurse awaits her, and baby is saved, with what we may describe as the   cheers of the populace.  br  br   This is not primarily the function of the milk station, but, then, on the  other hand selling milk is also only a part of the work of such a place. The blue front milk stations are meant, indeed, to furnish good, pure milk that can safely be drunk by the feeblest baby stomach, but it is the education of the mothers who come to the place.  br  br   The battle for the lives of children in New York is about to be   fought more fiercely than ever. Already this city stands far ahead of   any other on the continent in the care it gives its little children, and this year the New York Milk Committee, of 105 East Twenty-second Street, has   undertaken to give a demonstration to the city of the reduction that is possi-  ble through maintaining a large number of stations where good milk and   better advice are always ready for anyone who comes to seek.  br  br   It is submitted that it costs  50 to bury a baby. It has been demon-  strated that babies can be saved at a cost of  50 a year for each baby. The New York Milk Committee say - really it sounds very sensible:  All   things considered, we might just as wll save babies as bury them,   seeing that it does not cost any more.  br  br   The odd thing is that it has taken us some time to get the point   of this. It does seem pretty clear when it is pointed out, but we   have been floundering after it for a long time.    br  br Even last Summer, when New York had the lowest death rate among   the large cities fo the country, over 1,000 babies were buried in two weeks.    The number of babies born during the year equaled the population of New   Haven, and one-eighth of them died in the course of the twelve months.   And yet other cities made a far worse showing than New York.  br  br   The Department of Health did know how to save many of the babies.   It knew perfectly well, but that costs money, and the average taxpayer has   not yet grasped the fact that has come home to many individuals, that  50   for saving a baby is a better way to spend money than giving  50   for burying a baby. But this year as many of these deaths are   going to be prevented as possible, and the New York Milk Com-   mittee is to make what is intended to be a striking demonstration   of what can be obtained by a great big campaign against the deaths   that hide everywhere for the little mites.  br  br   The experiment is being made in close co-operation with the   Board of Health.   The value of the milk stations, says an expert on the question,  lies about 25 per cent. in the milk and 75 per cent. in the advice   given. It used to be the custom to prepare the milk for babies   according to a set formula, such and such for children under three   months old, and such and such for children a year old, etc. this   worked well enough for the  average  child, but unfortunately the   majority of children are not  average  at all. The New York Milk   Committee is taking a new system altogether.

        <pagetext>It is a very simple matter to teach a woman to prepare milk for her own chid. At every milk station there will be a nurse to do this. She will show any amount of patience that may be necessary in wrestling with idiosyn- crasies of each individual family, and not one mother will come away from the milk station without having an idea as clear as possible of the way in which the baby should be fed and cared for. br   br  Under the old system, when the milk was all prepared in little bottles, there were a dozen details that the mother neglected at home. The bottle was put down in a dirty place, the nipple was taken off, and cockroaches and similar lively insects would creep in. The mother did nothing about it,  because she had not been made to understand how important to health cleanliness was.   br   br The Milk Committee makes her understand this, and sees that the good done at the station is not undone by ignorant careless-  ness. The nurses will work in the homes, too, so far as possible, by fol-lowing up special cases.  br  br   illustration with title caption: INSTRUCTION IN THE HOME    br  br  There are doctors who will visit the station at stated times and who will  prescribe for every baby that comes. Not only do they prescribe the diet necessary for the child, but they are able to set the mother on the right  track if the child has some disease that requires special attention from a clinic. Not every baby, who comes to the station miserably undersized and puny, is suffering from malnutrition. When, however, it is malnutrition from which they suffer, it is singular to see the lines in their charts.   br  br Every baby that comes has a chart. Along the middle runs a line in- dicating the normal weight for a baby under a year. It goes in a long, slanting upward line. When the babies come in, little dots are put to register their relation to the line, and in practically every case these dots are a pitifully long way below the normal. A baby that should weigh fifteen pounds will weigh but eight or ten; then it gets its clutch upon the milk  bottle from the station, and presto  the line goes up so suddenly towards  the normal that it is almost perpendicular.  br  br  It is startling to see the instant improvement that follows the visits to the milk station. What ails the child usually is nothing in the world but starvation. It is useful thought to take home and ponder evenings when there is nothing else to do that hundreds of babies starve to death every year in New York City.

        <pagetext>1005 little white hearses passed through the streets of New York City in two weeks last summer. One-eighth of the 123,433 little ones born during the year, (equalling the population of New Haven, Conn.) died under twelve months. br  In the same squalid, poverty-smitten and congested districts where most of these deaths occured the Milk Committee maintained 7 in- fants' milk depots. Pure Milk was distributed on ice and the mothers taught how to care for it. Doctors at weekly classes taught the mothers how to feed their babies. Trained nurses visited their homes and taught them how to be clean and healthy. The babies of these mothers gained steadily in spite of the heat, poverty and congestion. Smiles and dimples came into their pinched faces; sleep came to the  br  tired women who watched over them. Sickness was prevented and  br lives were saved because the mothers were taught and because pure milk and a few essentials were provided at low cost.

        <pagetext> Some of the Committee' friends may be interested in the history of baby Carmina. We learned about her through a liitle girl who came to us and said her mother was sick and desired help. I went home with her and found the sick woman on a cot in the corner of a dark, ill ven-tilated room, bare of all furniture. She was weak, discouraged, and unwilling to talk -- a picture of a nervous break-down. The baby was crying and moaning. The husband had been out of work for a long time and the family income was  5 weekly which the oldest girl earned. One child had already died of intestinal trouble and this baby was going fast. br  It was so easy to care for the mother, to modify the milk and get the baby started right, but it meant so much for that family. Later the mother came to our classes. Her complete ignor- ance about herself and her baby was startling, but we taught her easily as she was so eager to learn. I wish you could see the baby now. It weighs 14 pounds at 5 months, and is a dear.  You would hardly know the mother; she is not a healthy woman yet but as all worry about her child has been removed she has confidence and strength again to live. Her face always wears a happy smile when she comes to see us.

        <pagetext>In calling attention to these errors the health officials wrote as follows: br   br The Health Officer of Indianapolis:  br   In the record which we sent you on January 15th, the  br  still births were included in the deaths under one year.  br  br  The Health Officer of Passaic:  br  br   The figures transmitted to your Committee were the same  br received from the Registrar, at which time I thought correct. But  br  after receiving your table of Infant Mortalities of the different br  cities reported to your office, this office with the idea of discov- br ering the real cause of our marked increase, checked up the in- br fant deaths under one year and after completing same found that  br  an error had been made, both in the number of births reported br  and also in the number of death under one year.  br  br  The Secretary-Board of Health, Perth Amboy: br  br   We misconceived the meaning of the term  'living births', and deducted from the living births (exclusive of still births) such deaths as had occured of infants under one year of age.  br  br  The monthly bulletins for the current year are coming in  br promptly from an increased number of cities - and their mortalit br  reports indicate that 1916 will show a substantial decrease over  br  previous years in most instances. br  New York Milk Committee

        <pagetext>The New York Milk Committee br    has br    Prepared and published the Fifth Annual Report of the Committee for 1911, giving the results of a successful two years' experiment to prove that milk equal to certified can be produced by the ordinary farmer from healthy herds and delivered to the consumer in New York at the price usually charged for bottled milk of uncertain quality.  br  br    Prepared and distributed 2,000 copies of a special report  Infant Mortality and Milk Stations,  furnishing a working basis to health officers and civic organizations undertaking the establishment of milk stations and baby-saving campaigns in their cities.    br  br    Actively co-operated with the Health Department in bringing about an efficient organization of the work in 55 municipal milk stations established as the result of the campaign in 1911.    br  br    Brought about through the co-operation of the Health Department and various social organization interested in baby-saving the formation ofa  Babies'Welfare Association.  This Association represents 150 agencies and has for its object the stadardization of methods and the proper distribution of work so as to eliminate duplication and over-lapping; to serve as a clearing house for information relating to the work of reducing infant mortality.    br  br    Provided the Babies' Welfare Association with an Executive Secretary and borne the expense of preparing and printing educational literature for distribution among tenement housing mothers.  Already 300,000 peiceds of literature hve been distributed in the English, Italian and Yiddish languages.  Although our vigorous campaign last year brought about the lowest baby death rate in the history of New York City there is every indication that the good record of last year will be not only maintained but exceeded.    br  br    Carried on throught its Committee on Womens' Organizations an active campaign among women's clubs, civic organizations and churches to demand a strict enforcement by the Health Department of the present rules and regulations relating to the production and sale of milk.    br  br    Conducted an exhaustive investigation as to the quality of milk served to patrongs of hotels, restaurants, lunch rooms and soda fountains in the business and shopping sections of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  The results of this investigation have been forwarded to the Board of Health and follow-up work already begun to insure a better and more wholesome milk supply to patrons of these places.    br  br    Appointed a Special Committe to study the present methods employed by the State to stamp out tuberculosis among cattle, and to formulate plans to obtain a more adequate State cotnrol of this disease.    br  br    Prepared comprehensive educational exhibits for the International Congress of Hygiene and Demography and for the New York State Fair.    br  br    Completed the first six months of its investigation of deaths for congenital diseases and its experiment to determine the balue of educating expectant mothers as a means of reducing infant mortality from these diseases.  822 mothers have already been educated in the prenatal care of their babies and themselves by a competent staff of nurses and doctors.  The results already obtained indicate that the death rate among babies from congenital disease can be reduced fully 50  and a higher vitality assured to babies if the tenement mothers are given proper instruction in mothercraft.

        <pagetext>ACCOMPLISHMENTS. br  br    I. Research: br    1. It carred on an experiment in infants' milk depots and through doctors and nurses which showed for the first time the relative importance of pure mik and education of mothers in the reduction of infant mortality. br  br    2. It made a comparative study of infant moratlity in rich, middle-class and tenement districts, which determined the close relation which prevails between ignorant poverty and a high infant mortality. br  br    3.  It made an investigation which determined that a large proportion of tenement families are unable to pay the present consumer's price for pure milk, and that a majority are unable to pay the price for modified milk for their babies. br  br    4.  It carried on a campaign of educational work through doctors and nurses which determined that the majority of mothers among the poor are capable of intelligently modifying the milk for their babies at home. br  br    5.  It demonstrated that clean milk which shall be cheap, is needed for the reduction of infant mortality rather than expensive modified milk. br  br        page break    6.  It demonstrated through its own philanthropic and educational milk company that clean milk, equal in its bacteriological count to certified milk, can be produced under established conditions and sold at the average price of milk. br  br    7.  It showed, by the inconclusive results obtained by feeding 700 infants in its milk depots on raw and pasteurized milk, the necessity of a thorough scientific experi-ment among infants under constant and complete control. br  br    8.  It demonstrated in its milk depts that the distribution of clean mlk, combined with the education of mothers and discriminating relief, furnishes the most economical and efficient means of reduc-ing infant mortality. br  br    9.  It made the first comprehensive study of bovine tuberculosis and its methods of control in New York State.  (In co-oper-ation with the New York City Committee on the Prevention of Tuberculosis.) br  br    10.  It studied and pointed out serious defects in the methods employed by the Municipal Civil Service Commission in selecting competent country and city milk inspectors. br  br

        <pagetext>1911 br   What We Accomplished br   Established 31 Infant Milk Stations. br   Took care of 7,919 babies at our Milk Stations. br   Educated 12,401 mothers in the care and feeding of their babies. br   Distributed 420,452 quarts of clean milk. br   Medical examinations given of 27,095 babies. br   Conducted a vigorous educational campaign on matters relating to the work of reducing infant mortality. br   Brought about the formation of the Infants' Milk Station Association of New York to eliminate duplication and to provide a clearing house for information relating to Milk Station activities.  br   Helped to reduce the infant death rate of babies under one year br   From 1910--125.6 per 1,000 births br   To 1911--111.6 per 1,000 births br   Prepared a report for the Board of Estimate and Approtionment shoeing the vlaue of Milk Stations as a means of decrasing the infatn death rate--a sufficient appropriation was gratned to establish 55 Municipal Milk Stations in 1912. br   Brought to a successful conclusion our two years' demonstration to show that a clean and safe milk can be produced under ordinary farm conditions and sold in New York at a price paid for inferior bottled milk.  The methods used in this demonstration have attracted a nation wide interest among milk experts and health officers. br   Our National Commission has completed its study of mik standards and the report is being published by the United States as a government document.  Its wide circulation will do much in influencing legislation for adeqaute milk standards. br        page break     1912 br   What We Want to Do br   Be prepared to cooperate with the Health De-partment in the development of Municipal Milk Stations until they become health centers for the education of mothers, and are made a basis for official control and supervision of midwives, boarded-out babies and children under school age. br   Keep the public informed as to the progress of the work of the Milk Stations, and advocate increasing the number of Stations until all the congested sections of the City are provided for. br   Bring about a better coordination of the activi-ties of all the agencies doing infant welfare work. br   Continue our active campaing to raise the stand-ard of New York's milk supply.  Investigate and expose fraudulent practices in the milk trade and defeat any attempt to legislate for lower milk standards. br   Conduct a nation wide campain to obtain the general adoption of adequate milk standards rec-commended by our National Commission. br   Carry on an investigation of congenital dis-eases, and an experiment to determine the value of educating expectant mothers as a means of re-ducing infant mortality from these diseases. br   Make available to Health Officers and Civic Organizations throughout the country informa-tion relating to Infatn Milk Station work, and be prepared to extend cooperation wherever re-quested, and share the credit for results accom-plished with all due generosity where it is de-served. br   Establish a position of leadership for the com-mittee and make it indispensable in its field. br

        <pagetext>A LETTER TO EXPECTANT MOTHERS br  br  Dear Mothers: br  Last year fully five thousand babies died in New York before they were one month old.  They died because they were born too weak to combat the diseases of babyhood.  They were born weak because their mothers did not properly care for themselves during the period of pregnancy; overwork, lack of exercise, in-sufficient or improper nourishment, irregularity in eating and sleeping, worry and nervousness were some of the many causes. br  br  Every mother desires to have her baby born healthy and strong.  Every baby has right to be so born.  You can do much at this time to insure your baby being born well and strong.  Prepare yourself in advance--be regular in your habits; build yourself up by eating wholesome food; avoid beer, whiskey and drugs; talk to your doctor about yourself, or go to any BABIES' PURE MILK STATION for advice. br  br  When the time comes for the baby to be born, you must use special care so as not to have your own health or that of your baby impaired.  Remember that one-half of all the blindness in this world is due to improper care of the baby's eyes immediately after birth. br  br  To avoid having your own health and that of your baby impaired at the time of birth, you will need especial care.  Obtain the best.  It will be worth while.  If you can go to the hospital, do so by all means; there you will receive proper medical and nursing care for yourself and baby.  Select from the list of hospitals given in this circular, the one to which you desire to apply for admission, and make arrangements at least two weeks in advance of the date of confinement. If you cannot leave br  br   page break  br  your home because of other children, go to a  Blue Front  BABIES' PURE MILK AND HEALTH STATION for advice; there the nurse will be glad to tell you of hospitals and settlements which will provide medical treatment and nurse services in your own home.  Many agencies will furnish female physicians in desired.  These services can be obtained at a small charge, or free if you cannot afford to pay. br  Do not forget you owe it to your unborn babe to bring it into the world well and strong. This you can do only if you are willing to learn how. br  br   a list of hospitals follows

    <unmapped>[in handwritten script:   Project for supplying New York with milk. June 1819] Arrangements for an extensive and permanent establishement under the above title having been made by the subscriber, on the plan of the best establishments ofa similar nature in Great Britain, he takes this method of informing his friends and fellow-citizens that he will be ready to supply them with milk on the first of June next, and at all times after that date, on receiving ten days previous notice.&lt;br&gt; In the mean while he begs leave respectfully to solicit their encouragement of his enterprise on the following conditions and assurances, viz.:&lt;br&gt; 1. That he will serve them with milk delivered in its original purity, uncorrupted by any mixture or adulteration whatsoever.&lt;br&gt; 2. That he will therefore carefully avoid the excessive use too frequently made of the slops of distilleries in feeding the cows, which is well known to impoverish the milk, if not to infect it with unwholesome qualities.&lt;br&gt; 3. That he will spare no pains to preserve and deliver the mik clean; bestowing his personal and careful attention to give it this most important and unusual recommendation.&lt;br&gt; 4. That in distributing the milk by his carriers he will employ such precautions as shall preclude the possibility, either from carelessness or design, of the fraud of deficient measure; which in the usual mode of distribution is so easily and securely practised on the negligence of servants.&lt;br&gt; 5. That the milk shall be served to his customers with the strictest attention to punctuality; at any hour of the day, and in any quantity, that may be desired; -- the situation of his establishment, only two miles from the City Hall, on the Eighth Avenue, affording peculiar facilities for their accommodation in this respect.&lt;br&gt; 6. That his milk, thus pure, clean, correctly measured, and punctually served, shall always be delivered to his customers at the lowest market price.&lt;br&gt; Finally; that having provided buildings for his stables of the most commodious and substantial construction, and large enough to admit of between two and three hundred separate stalls, he will prosecute his design with assiduous fidelity to these conditions and assurances, yielding to no obstables or dificulties it may encounter, so long as the patronage of his friends and the public may encourage his perseverance.  And on these grounds, connected with the obvious public utility of an establishment of this nature, so managed as to deserve and justify the public confidence, he again respectfully solicits their encouragement of his enterprise in the outset.&lt;br&gt; THOMAS WARNER.&lt;br&gt; N.B. Persons wishing to be supplied with milk on the above conditions, are invited to leave their applications, addressed to the subscriber, at the Post-office, specifying where they live, and when, and with what quantity of milk, they would be served.  And if any should wish for a further and more minute explanation of the plan of the proposed establishement, and of the means of carrying it into effect, and will signify that wish as here directed, it shall be promptly attended to.</unmapped>
